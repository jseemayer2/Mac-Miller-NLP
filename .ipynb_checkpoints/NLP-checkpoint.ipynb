We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building and he would help me with things and I would see him and think \"what a cute guy\" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little we got to know, just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being...finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...  So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.Uh, look  Good Evening  Yeah  When I party in New York, take the late night subway  Goin\\' out Friday to comin\\' home Monday  From all directions never find me on the one way flavor  The rhyme just the icin\\' on the cupcake fuck face  My fans notice these other rappers is bogus  I\\'m Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  And the boy stay, kickin\\' incredibly dope shit  Make my mama proud cause my clothes fit  Travel round the globe bitch, on my Lewis Clark shit  Don\\'t matter where I live, cause I can tell you where my heart is  I just stay on my side, fuck where everybody at  Tell the planet peace cause I\\'m gone I ain\\'t comin\\' back  Had the whole regular life I can tell you that I\\'m done with that  Try to build a mill off a couple stacks  On my own business, investin\\' all I got into these fuckin\\' raps  Willie Parker money, hand it off then it\\'s runnin\\' back  Ayo you fuck wit\\' dat  Uh you gotta fuck wit\\' dat  You in love wit\\' dat  Look, uh, Mac Miller  Takin\\' sips from the fountain of youth  If you ain\\'t heard about the kid then you out of the loop  As I\\'m sittin\\' back starin\\' at this world in my eyes  See out the window in my room that I’m hidden inside  I\\'m just a kid who stays speakin\\' his thoughts, talkin\\' his mind  Life a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride  Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry  There’s logic behind the way stayin\\' caught in a lie, boy  Ain\\'t a shock that I\\'m a topic of discussion  Ma\\'fuckers want my spot so they probably wish I wasn\\'t  They give a little love like everyone does  In reality, they stoned off that competitive drug  And I don\\'t blame \\'em, \\'cause those who above me, I\\'m gunnin\\' for  Try and make my way to the top, startin\\' from the floor  And I don\\'t even need to bring a single gun to war  \\'Cause I be on some shit that they ain\\'t never done before  Takin\\' over piece by piece, startin\\' from the core  It\\'s only been a year, I can stick around a hundred more  Said I could stick around a hundred more  I ain\\'t goin\\' nowhere  Young and so much time to go  Jerm, you might as well keep this one rollin\\'  I got like one more verse I haven\\'t spit three verses in a song in a minute  See if I can remember this one  Aight look  You can find me in the lab workin\\' overtime  Smell the weed when you going by, global grind  And I ain\\'t just a local guy  When you feelin\\' stressed out, have an L  Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanel  Live fast when I die better wish me well  Huh, I just hope they servin\\' beer in hell  Just an everyday story that I\\'m here to tell  So please, stick around for the Epilogue  For anyone who ever blog, probably heard my name  Hip-Hop\\'s underdog, you wanna win the game  I\\'m sick of hearin\\' how music change never be the same  And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane  Call yourself a vet, but haven\\'t won a single game  Mad, every girl got my name imprinted in her brain  Boy I\\'m a beast, match the style in bars  Find me smokin\\' weed where the wild things are  Yessir  So I mean, I had to take this time  Real quickly, to just go in  I don\\'t know man I feel like you should never stop goin\\' in on your shit  That\\'s just me  I mean, Q and Treej out there we excited just makin\\' history  And Jerm of courseBetter act right, \\'cause I smack dykes  Give \\'em blow and a bit of that bagpipe  Bitch wanna live that rap life, but I already hit that last night  Think you\\'re fuckin\\' with me, huh?

tambourine  I know I love you I aint tryna let those words slip  Pure bliss I knew that we would stay together we in cursive  Infatuation when every single move you make is fascinatin  Gravitatin towards anything that gives a sense of happiness  Activist love activeness  Sendin my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists  Hope you found what you lookin for  I hope you found what you lookin for  You take away the pain and I thank you for that  If I ever get the chance bet Im paying you back  Imma be waiting for that Imma be waiting for that  Misery—you represent love you the epitome  So wish for me Ill come out of nowhere—your epiphany  Disconnect from everybody  Who dont understand my vision yet  In a jet is where my mind is so I light another cigarette  To calm me down  So calm me down  Everybody who can save me now is not around chopper down  Busy today but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds  In between purgatory aint as bad as it would seem to be  Live a dream thats so cliché  But I cant tell you what it means to me  You take away the pain and I thank you for that  If I ever get the chance bet Im paying you back  Imma be waiting for that Imma be waiting for that  And so it is to the printing press  To the recorder of mans deeds—the keeper of his conscience  —the courier of his news—that we look for strength and assistance—confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be—free and independentLook comin with the flows of a veteran Mac class president  All black Letterman recognize a gentleman  Know anything but formal take you out the

around and go home  They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense  These things that a man doesnt need  Take out the love and the passion and hope  And they fill it with nothing but greed  While floating through galaxies they said I couldnt  I noticed how sad one can get  Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful I find  I cant understand nothing no more  If I jump let me fall  If I jump

head  It kinda feel like its a purgatory  So polite and white but I got family who would murder for me  Think Im living paradise so would I have to worry bout  Dealing with these demons feel the pressure  Find the perfect style  Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love  All these backfires of my experiments with drugs  And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form  The difference between love and war inform me  Im above the norm  But give me anybody though Ill gladly chew his face off them bath salts  Rhyming like its summertime on asphalt hot  Havent picked a major label think Im blackballed  I still dont got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls  Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice  I put this music against my life I think I fear the choice  And I dont know what Im running from but Im running still  I conversate with acquaintances but its nothing real  Im from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel  So a hundred mills wouldnt make me sign a fucking deal  Money kills thats the truth its called the root of evil  But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove  So if you aint talking bout some money Imma send

let it snow  Thats just me all wilding out and being extra doe  And if God was a human itd be yours truly watching horror movies  With some foreign groupies thinking this decor suits me  I do drugs to get more loopy Im in tune  To ancient jujitsu spirituals its blissful  Looking out as far as eyes can see  Im glad that me and this elevation could finally meet  I think Im JFKs final speech  They try assassinating all of my beliefs  But Im asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind  And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine  Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time  If yall would leave me the fuck alone thatd be divine  Cant decide if you like all the fame  Three years ago to now its just not the same  Im looking out my window ashing on the pane  Shit wonder if I lost my way  Dont you ever wanna hide away  Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain  Wont give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today  Ill greet the devil with a smiling face  Shit that God fellow may reside in space  As times a wasting Im freebasing with Freemasons  My girls switching the locks the keys keep changing  Dreaming of places my own personal creations  If theres a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted  Retracing my steps way back to Biblical times  Wewe all gon end up meeting at the finishing line  And these words that I command you today shall be in your heat  And you shall teach them diligently to your children  And you shall speak of them when you sit at home  And when you walk along the way and when you lie down  And when you rise up I am the lord your godLet me get a

cant expect the unexpected these dreams are manifested  From my head into reality they seems a bit excessive  But I dont stress it two hands to count my blessings  All the times that Ive been reckless with an ego big as Texas  Thinkin Im the man I never let these hoes inside the plan  My room for bullshit in the crib as small as a childs hands  I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand  I am the fire man shit Im way too fly to land yeah  Im smokin weed all alone on the road  Even though I know they need me at home  Keep my control from a city where its freezin and cold  Each to their own punches like this probably beat up Stallone  And all that drama that you comin with you blowin my high  On my way up to the function gettin dome in my ride  I got em worried that my mind fried  Im goin up before I skydive  You can see the way that time flies  Time files try to catch it  Time flies  Time flies try to catch it  One day we will we will find  We will conquer conquer with
