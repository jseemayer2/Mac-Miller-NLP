I

Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her

With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em

Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta

Can a man live? And it's all day, homie

I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get 'em all paid

Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American

 Shit, we All-American, yeah 

I swear to God I put the hero in heroin, these flows kilos

I could sell snow to a ski slope

I could sell evil to the devil, nonbelievers to a temple

Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat

And these eyes is iconic

I went pro, made profit, now I keep some dead faces in my pocket

Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week

But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G

Twisting my weed, easing my mind

Why you worry about me? Stop tripping, I'm fine

Swear these bitches done lost it lately

You put the ho in honest baby, so complicated

And I may be a little arrogant, I'm aware of it

I know I know

I got a problem, I'ma take care of it, weight I'm carrying, gotta let it go

It won't hold me down no more

Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her

With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em

Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta

Can a man live? And it's all day, homie

I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get 'em all paid

Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American

 Shit, we All-American 

We ain't goin'

Nowhere, we ain't

Goin' nowhere, we can't be

Stopped now, 'cause this rap shit's for life

We ain't goin'

Nowhere, we ain't

Goin' nowhere, we can't be

Stopped now, 'cause this rap shit's for life

Back then I had a dream

I'd get this money, man

I know my life would change

Just need a hundred grand

Back then I had a dream

I'd get this money, man

I know, my life would change

Just need a hundred grand

Back when I first made a hundred grand

Yeah, back when I first made a...

Yeah

Back when I first made a hundred grand

Yeah

Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand

Thought I was the shit

When I first made a hundred grand

Thought I was a king

When I first made a hundred grand

Couldn't tell me nuttin

When I first made a hundred grand

Made a hundred grand

Yeah, okay, back then they used to call me little

But now I'm ridin' something clean in a coat made of armadillo

They haven't got the memo, they sayin' I'm the shit though

Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple 

Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is

A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius

Sin everyday, someone save me please

And get schooled, homie, change degrees

I'm the plug, what you need though? I'm goin' beast mode

I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat 

I made a mil' before I paid a bill

Cause fools worried about a wave, I'm a Navy SEAL

Come with me, I can make your life change for real

Always had a dream of stuntin'

It ain't nothing unless we runnin' shit

Just a young motherfucker with a plan

Thought I was the man

Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand

Thought I was the shit

When I first made a hundred grand

Thought I was a king

When I first made a hundred grand

Couldn't tell me nuttin

When I first made a hundred grand

Sometimes I see the uh

Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is

I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it

I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise

Then I couldn't heal the pain in it

I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows though

Get a pay check, spend it all on polo

Designer brands cover up my insecurities

Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe though

Now I'm dressin' so expensive, for no reason

Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'

I got a family, can't afford a coat

So I leave a little paper there before I go

Spend a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke

Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show

This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free

Remember love, if you can't, remember me

Dear people on earth after I die, what's the weather like?

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and I ain't perfect but I try

Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe get a second life

This time I'm a get it right

It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on

I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this

Still, plantin' seeds so my money long

Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon' itch

I wish we could just all get rich

Sometimes not havin' money is all I miss

And yet these hoes that roll up on my dick

The all American girl, that's just a blond head bitch

Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?

Could we figure out what God might've miss?

It's funny that these questions never get an answer

Life a bitch sometimes you got to reprimand her

Never understand her, why should I even try?

Live forever then you never feel the need to die

This a letter, open it to set you free

Remember love and remember me

Dear people on earth after I die, what's the weather like?

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and I ain't perfect but I try

Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe get a second life

This time I'm a get it right

What does it mean to be a sensation? Do you have to be sensational?

And how you know you made it?

When you're with Killa Cam, watchin' Paid in Full

I never had good grades in school but, shock the world is what I came to do

I got a song I wanna play for you, so can you sing that back to me?

What does it mean to be a sensation? Do you have to be sensational?

Eric

Well

I don't need to lie no more

Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind

And she don't cry no more

She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...

I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more

Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines

It ain't 2009 no more

Yeah, I know what's behind that door

Yeah, okay you gotta jump in to swim

Well, the light was dim in this life of sin

Now every day I wake up and breathe

I don't have it all but that's all right with me

Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me

Send you back home with a light that's beamin'

The whole team 'bout to figure it out

We ice cold, that's what winter about

And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route

Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm

Have a ball with a dribble and bounce

'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah

Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money

Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly

I was yea high and muddy

Lookin' for what was lookin' for me

But I don't need to lie no more

Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and

It ain't 2009 no more

Yeah, I know what's behind that door

Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for

Well, because I've never been this high before

It's like I never felt alive before

Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war

See me and you, we ain't that different

I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'

Take my time to finish, mind my business

A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole

Big enough to bury my soul

Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own

My own, with these arms I can carry you home

I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry

You don't ever gotta worry

Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low

When your heart get cold

See what's behind all them unturned stones

And I'm a pro when it come to my job

But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God

Now when it gets hard

I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm

Because I don't need to lie no more

Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and

She don't cry no more

She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...

I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more

6,5 O’Clock,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-5-oclock-lyrics,The High Life,True,"Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And following a dollar finds nothing but stress

A marathon grind like I'm running from rest

It's 

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And following a dollar finds nothing but stress

But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest

The streets empty 'round 5 o'clock

Driving by the cops

Low key microscopic to the eyes that watch

Everything a hustle when you trying come buy some guap

I'm a keep grinding 'till I'm shining like a diamond watch

Me and bo-head bringing you the truth

With all night sessions we just living in the booth

Strong bars like we spitting out 150 proof

Take shots, get loose, 'till you spitting up yo' food 

You see that? I'm a need a recap

Grab a weed sack chief that 'till my feet flat

I got this covered like a pro bowl d-back

Breathe rap and I been known to make the beat clap

Need cash so I'm trying to move some trees fast

Tell you where the meat at

Ask you where the cheese at

People 'round the city see the youngin' and respect the grind

Putting in the extra time

Guaranteed next to shine

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And following a dollar finds nothing but stress

A marathon grind like I'm running from rest

It's 

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And following a dollar finds nothing but stress

But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest

I rise before the sun come up and get my day started

Pray to the most high, I roll up my haze and spark it

And then my paper starts to roll in

Money in paper bags

Hammers with laser tags

We grown men

Out on the corner 'till the early morn'

The blood of a hustler getting mines before I was born

You get stormed by these hot ass bars

From me and Easy Mac

Crusin' in the 'Lac smoking weed with no seeds in that

There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us 

Except these labels anticipating and waiting on us

They get the BBS's, radios play us

Then we blaze in the Benz's

And sit this off on BBS's

And from P.A to Texas

These niggas know about me

International hustler can't move no snow without me

Or get no dough without me

Niggas getting they stacking on

Early bird get the worm

I'm out here at the crack of dawn

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And following a dollar finds nothing but stress

A marathon grind like I'm running from rest

It's 

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And following a dollar finds nothing but stress

But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest"
8,Aliens Fighting Robots,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-aliens-fighting-robots-lyrics,Macadelic,True,"Y'all is dead weight, less great, always getting second place

I tend to race ahead of pace, dipping while I'm dressed in Bape

Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't Dicaprio

This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall

Capicola sandwiches are tasty from Primanti's

I'm a 5'7"" giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning

Girls want makeup, get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning

So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming

For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more

With money, cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for

Feeling like a hundred wars are going on currently

Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency

Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee

How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak

Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus

Acting like you fucking with me, that's some shit I can't excuse

Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe

You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works

I plan to do, something that ain't tangible

Now I'm 'bout to hand it to the homie Michael Rocks, hear what he saying to you

Take a trip, took a molly out with Banco Populari

The word around the city is he sit in a Ferrari

I told myself I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry

That's my bad, I party 'til my cardies get foggy

Can't keep her hands off of me, got her lock, then lost the key

Weed smoke, make it hard to see, we go harder than the Carter one

Excuse me baby pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?

Not saying it's coming soon, but I want the real show

Get me the treatment that you getting all the heels for

The shit they paying all the bills for

Man, I missed it, that cake taste delicious

They can't wait for vacations, paid for, by pictures

I'm feeling good, I'm peeling bills, I'm real as hell

I don't front, I roll blunts and papers

I don't fuck with fakers, your girl is asking me if I'mma take her

I'm straight though, you see, I'm booked up 'til April

That's mine, that's me, I take those, you tryna see some pesos

Then shake though, you get exactly what you pay for

Stop acting like you can't go, you swagging to the ankles

I feel you baby, hopefully I look familiar maybe

Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love

But you will never ever get it because

It seem like it only happen when I'm holding the drugs

And you can never ever see her because

Life a cliche, it ain't a bad one

First the plane land, and then the bags come

We walking on this planet seeking action

Break a girl's heart, sorry Miss Jackson

Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love

But you will never ever get it because

It seem like it only happen when I'm holding the drugs

And you can never ever see her because

And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots

And all the ladies take their clothes off

I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock

This some shit you won't top

And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots

And all the ladies take their clothes off

I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock

This some shit you won't top

I'm so high, won't you think about that babe

On some other shit that tend to make me act crazy

15 thousand, blow it on clothes

6 in the morning, still sitting here throwed

I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know

Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home

Buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know

Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home"
9,All Around The World,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-all-around-the-world-lyrics,Best Day Ever,True,"I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up

Warn the neighbors it’s a party, so go tell everybody

We party all around the world

We party all around the world

We party all around the world

I got my cup filled, bitches all around me on some bachelor shit

Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks

Around the world I use my atlas make a map of it

Globe trotter, ho hopper, superstar asterik

People always wonder so they ask us who we are

Rolling up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar

Wanna be on top and tryna to get there by tomorrow

See the money, bitches, bubbly, designer clothes, foreign cars

But I ain’t never gonna change

Different city everyday

You hear these people scream my name

They think I’m underage

They don’t know shit about the game

Till I’m drunk as fuck, on the couch, pouring out champagne

Living life like it’s my job, and I don’t ever take a day off

Shit ain’t been the same since I seen my music take off

I be on some “I don’t give a fuck” shit

Still with my homies I came up with so celebrate the fact that we young, rich, and famous

I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up

Warn the neighbors it’s a party, so go tell everybody

We party all around the world

We party all around the world

We party all around the world

We party all around the world

Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France

Bitches of every nationality get up and dance

So, let me see your hands please

We makin’ noise like a stampede

So much smoke up in this bitch you can’t breathe

Somewhere where it’s sandy, Cali or Miami

This the only way to do never made a plan B

Can’t we, get it how we live

Tonight ain't the night to chill, tonight we do it big

Girls, comin’ all dressed up and they takin’ off their clothes

We know your man an ameteur so come party with some pros

You need something new, I know your life is gettin’ old

We ain’t gettin’ younger so tonight's the night to go

So, crazy, treat it like your last night

Even if you broke, spend tonight like you cash right

It’s the fast life, don’t worry baby we ain’t here to slow it down

Tonight we goin’ crazy and tomorra’ you can hold me down

I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up

Warn the neighbors it’s a party, so go tell everybody

We party all around the world

We could be together, but you scared to

And when I blow I hope you know

That I could have any girl I choose

But I know as time goes by, baby all I'm gonna want is you

Look, they told me never fall in love, it never works out in your favor

You way too young and right now that's just human nature

You think you love her, but you don't

Think you gon be with her for the rest of your life, you prolly won't

But on my side, shorty just attacked me from the blindside

Used to be a player now I'm sidelined

Connect like Wi-fi, mixed like tye-dye

She feelin' cute wanna wear a little lingerie, voila

It ain't a sexual thing though

We be stayin' up smokin' weed out her window

In love with me now, she never huntin' me down

I'm tryna have it all, she ain't comin' around

It's like a never endin' chase, longer than a marathon

See the smile on her face, and I can't help but carry on

I know you love me don't lie , but you just gotta be mine

But I know as time goes by, baby all I'm gonna want is you

Look, I know this girl who want the world to call her own

Goin' through these dudes like some minutes on a phone

And once she leave, she ain't comin' back home

Hit the road forgettin' about everybody she know

Miss hasn't called me in four days

But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay

Hey, she tryna be a lil' player, think she cute too

But I'mma yank her out the game like a loose tooth

When the boy blow, I know she worried

About all these girls who approach me actin' flirty

See that's the thing thing, I don't give a fuck

I want your heart so baby give it up

In this life girl, all we can do is try

Forget that dumb stuff, it's just you and I

We can travel 'round the world movin' through the sky

Or we can stay right here and you'll be mine

Girl, I don't wanna share you

We could be together, but you scared to

I ain't gonna leave you

And when I blow I hope you know

Stay thinking about the future

Path is limitless, death, well that's ridiculous

I'm a live forever, cause a legend never die

See the world as simple, but complex in the design

I spent some time just thinkin'

Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'

Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?

Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source

Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list

Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted

Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia

Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one

Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun

And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run

Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public

Motherfucker, welcome to America

My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split

Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public

Welcome to America

Motherfucker, welcome to America

Still, in a room filled with holographic images

Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it

Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed

Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed

Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest

Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress

See, this is what I do the best

Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest

Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior

I take part to stay far from coroners

I heard some corny words said about my music though

Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho

Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio

First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul

So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options

American born, impeccable form above and beyond, never the norm

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split

Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public

Welcome to America

Motherfucker, welcome to America

My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split

Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public

Welcome to America

Motherfucker, welcome to America

Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? Bet I steal her

Shout out my wigga Mac Miller, comin' up in a world full of killers

I'll be shaded up at the villa

With a girl that know what the deal is

They don't know I come from the illest

City on the map, we don't know how to act, ahh!

Realest young rappin go getters in America

Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go

CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's

We the future so every night is a new day

Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low

Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show

I can trigger the wave in my sleep

Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat

Wake up shower, get paid and repeat

Spit one flow and got made on the streets

Welcome to the land where you never stay for free

Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal

Veggies

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split

Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public

Welcome to America

Motherfucker, welcome to America

My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split

Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public

Welcome to America

Motherfucker, welcome to America

Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick

Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6

Rise to the top, the topics change

The Glocks in the Stock Exchange

Now watch the price of life on the block drop, insane

You can't stop this reign, don't name drop in vain

Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward strange

Last week he was nothin', boxers stain

Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame

To the top I aim, testin' waters so I've been afloat

No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes

Sun got shine, now they say he shady but he never dippin' though

Still facing L's, you would think a nigga's wins was low

What you think I'm in this for?

Won't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope

End the flow or behind bars droppin' prison soap

Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though

I'm record spittin' Guinness flows

Got it up in sources now he in the store

People are just uptight because the kids are having fun and they didn't have the same freedom because they didn't take it, they just followed the lines laid down by their parents"
16,A Million Dollars,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-a-million-dollars-lyrics,The High Life,True,"I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen

Bitch please, I'ma make a million

Bitch please, I'ma make a million

Cause, I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen

Bitch Please, I'ma make a million

With ease, I'ma make a million

A lotta' times I don't get the credit

Forgettin' about my ethical work

Let it be first said that I'm here to earn bread

I been dedicatin' ever since I turned 10

Got the type of style quickly gonna turn heads

I been workin', part time hustla'

Hit you with a dub, feedin' bubblas, 

On the road with a dollar and a dream

Cause anything is possible, believe bitch please

It ain't nothin' to spit, sparkin' up in the whip

Stayin' stuck up on my dreams like they rubber cement

No one ever sees a legend when he stuck on the bench

And my screw's so loose it'll fuck up your wrench

My head, can't contain all these dreams of mine

When I'm rich there's some shit I'm gonna' leave behind

For now, it's food for thought it'll feed your mind

But you can't get a piece of mind

Nah homie

I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen

Bitch please, I'ma make a million

Bitch please, I'ma make a million

Cause, I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen

Bitch Please, I'ma make a million

With ease, I'ma make a million

Now, I can either try and be a hero

Or I can grab a one with six zeros

What would I do with a million dollars?

First off, I'd start payin' bills to my father

Then pay for college, get TreeJay a camera

Grab a spot in LA, a crib in Atlanta

Cop a Phantom, just to ride in

Some celebrity friends to get high with

Couple four models that I find dine with

Cause the music that I make is timeless

The pressures on, don't choke, Heimlich

Maneuver, got my songs all through your computer

You wonderin' ""is it buzz or just a rumor ""

I'm Superman, y'all just Lex Luther

I'mma make a mil, that's for real no deal

Just the illest mothafucka in the bill, so chill

I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen

Bitch please, I'ma make a million

Bitch please, I'ma make a million

Cause, I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen

Bitch Please, I'ma make a million

With ease, I'ma make a million"

Yeah, um

Uh

Ladies and gentleman

Yeah

Whew, that drip

Yeah, okay

Writin' on writer's block, haven't slept in days

They wanna put me in the psycho watch, everyone's afraid

Of what I do inside my studio, worried I'ma lose control

They rufflin' my feathers and they shuffling the Yu-Gi-Oh! 

Execution flow, at your neck like new cologne

Uno, dos, bitch, I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger though

My brain fried, always chasing the same high

I'm too fucked up to function, do nothin' but waste time

Woke up annihilated, lyin' on the pavement

Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape

And I know that it's Friday, 'cause every Friday they have a parade

In-front of city hall, hear 'em celebrate, they havin' a ball

My pupils dilated, highly dehydrated, I'm lost inside a giant matrix

Isolate myself from eyes I find contagious

Jump above the comedown

I'm strung out and nodding off inside the dugout

Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah

Feels so good to feel this free

What are you afraid of? Tell me what you made of

What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust!

La da da da da da da da

La da da da, la da da 

La da da da la da da da 

La da da da, ayy 

Yeah

I'm playing hot potato on a Winnebago

The chips are stale, they taste okay though when they dipped in queso

And what's an angel with a missin' halo?

She will drop out of school to take a trip to DayGlow

Found a twenty laying by the sewer rats

You know little Stewart hasn't been in any movies lately

He's spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex

His agent workin' hard to try and book him a commercial

What I do should not concern you, do this 'til I turn blue

Not Eric Sermon, I'm more Merlin, curses turn 'em into bird food

Hurry to make the first move, I'm walking like Herschel

And now we at the end of verse two, oh

Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah

Feels so good to feel this free

What are you afraid of? Tell me what you made of 

What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust!

La da da da da da da da 

La da da da, la da da 

La da da da, la da da da

I fuck around with amnesia, pour 4 inside of my liter

One day I'm a get it all cleaned up, right now I'ma dirty my jeans up

This what I do, start the day, picture bring back all the pain

All that shit that's hard to say, had a vision, lost its way

This planet different that we live in, yeah, I bet it is

Product of the new world, you stuck in Genesis

And I'm just tryna rep my city right like Bettis did

I got a crazy girl that's filled with all these fetishes

Plus she can get me high when I'm feelin' low

Fill my cup with purple, baby, drink it slow

And I can take you anywhere you wanna go

Don't, don't be afraid

Don't be afraid

I told her please don't take this back from me, this feelin' come so naturally

Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically

You get me high, hold me there, this is real, girl, don't be scared

It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you

Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grow apart or last forever

Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you, lookin' in your eyes

Don't be afraid of what can get you high

Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly

I, I, I, I

I wonder where will I meet the perfect girl that I dream of

For now I need no huge tits, I'm cool with just a good B cup

Uh, you're now free to ball, build it up then keep it all

She don't need to call, if love a landing then we could fall

Could we drop that and say everything that we've not said?

I'm telling you that you hard to trust, you sayin' I got a hard head

This forever, don't you ever think to let me go

And if I'm talkin' to the world, I need to let 'em know

She can get me high when I'm feelin' low

Fill my cup with purple, baby, drink it slow

And I can take you anywhere you wanna go

Don't, don't be afraid

Don't be afraid

I told her please don't take this back from me, this feelin' come so naturally

Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically

19,A Night In The Studio,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-a-night-in-the-studio-lyrics,The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown,True,"Ay yo Josh

Ay yo where the fuck you at man?

What you mean you on your way yo'

Our session was at 9 its fuckin’ 11

I'm out here, blowed, smokin L’s

Waitin for yo ass

I don't even think I got..

Oh no I definitely still got some weed for the lab

But still when you gonna be here?

Soon? Mother fucker how soo..

Oh there you are right now

Ay yo whats good bruh?

Ay yo whats good bro

Shit chillin’

Yeah I'm tryin to go to the studio or whatever

Yeah I got shit to drop mother fucker

I always got shit to drop damn

Ight you’ll meet me there?

I woke up scratched my nuts

Rolled a swisher on the shitter

Got blowed then I light me up a cigarette

The coolest flow coolio a movie roll

Now I’m tryna head up to the lab

I headed to the studio open the door

Say wassup to everybody who was posted before

I’m bout to record, they know I’m smokin’ of course

Blow some haze in the air, pull out my notebook

Then I head up to the booth, load the beat off my email

Phone on silent, ignorin’ calls from females

My man Josh sit down, get the tempo

Put on my headphones

Ight, let’s go

I let go intro of the beats startin’

Say a couple words try not to be retarded, huh

Cuz I'm a goofy dude doin' what I choose to do

Eatin’ tracks up like some snacks call me scooby doo

Now the beat about to drop verse 1

Its like a war when the soldier pull the first gun

Everything’s blank it’s just me and the mic

I don’t read a lot, so I try and see what I write

Visualize the melody, hypnotize everybody watchin

I hope they ain’t blink they eyes

Cuz you don’t wanna miss a fuckin second

When I’m catchin wreck

I be in the booth goin’ off try to catch my breath

Couple more bars, couple seconds left

Killin’ em softly takin’ extra steps

They never guessed I be murderin’ and blessin’

Ight the first done but before we start the second

We gotta do mad shit

Doubles and adlibs

And Josh make it sound like magic

He a old school genius with the pro tools

Tryna school me on everything that the pros do

I tell him that he needs to think it in the book

But for now we makin guap just singin’ on some hooks

So I don’t worry bout the chorus

The track gotta hook on it

And my verses with that, they sound good on it

Now I do a second maybe do a third

If I’m in the mood to go crazy with my words

I take a lil’ break got some haze to burn

The cats sittin’ outside can wait they turn

We makin’ classics in the session

Mom’s askin me these questions

""When you comin' home? You got school.""

Nah, I’m suspended

After this track done burn the last blunt smokin’ good

Payin’ for my time with stolen goods

Say peace to whoever, outside its dark

I’m blowed and can’t find where the fuck I parked

So I beep the car, oh there it is

Lets go ahead and dip, hop in the whip

Light a cigarette and sit

Gotta ride home ahead of us

Slumped in the back

Tell my man wit the whip to bump on my track

Tryna ride out, and I’m high now"
20,Another Night,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-another-night-lyrics,The High Life,True,"Lately I just been workin', writin'

Haven't really got outta the crib too much

As I spend another night without a single thing to do

'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you

My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through

Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too

That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'

Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm

I'm just a regular kid, at my crib

Doin' regular shit, burnin' 5 spliffs

I'm so high, another night alone

So I'm a pour another cup and roll another zone

I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back

So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at

Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh

You wanna find me, hit me on Twitter

Wow, that sound mad lame

People love me, they don't even know my last name

Waitin' at the station till it's time that I can board the train

Headin' to the fortune fame, should explore my brain

See what I'm thinkin bout

Pour a little liquor then I drink it down

'Cause it's just another night on my own

Layin' back as I light up my Dro

It's just another night alone

I spend another night alone

Said it's just another night on my own

Layin' back as I light up my Dro

It's just another night alone

I spend another night alone

I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away

Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play

I thank god for blessin' me with life every day

And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gate

I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways

That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight

Nothin' left to say now it's time for action

No more bullshit, no more relaxin'

Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'

Spend a couple nights and

Burn out all the lights in

My room, stuck in my crib like glue

That's what I do it's nothin' new

'Cause it's just another night on my own

Layin' back as I light up my Dro

It's just another night alone

I spend another night alone

Said it's just another night on my own

Layin' back as I light up my Dro

It's just another night alone

I spend another night alone"

Yeah

Turn the beat up a little bit

Yeah

Uh

Yeah

I've been rappin' since the apparition

G-g-g-god was gonna kill me and I'm glad he didn't

Might have made a bad decision

He just left me with an ocean and a bad religion

While Mary Magdalene laughin', smokin' a pack of Winstons

Up on a church hill, acid trippin' with older men

As they tell her stories, she's seducin' them

But she's only usin' them

My studio is filled with spirits

And every single lyric dedicated to my dearest friends

Yeah, and lord knows that we hate the questions

So back and forth, exchange faces over why I'm playin' table tennis at dinner

I end up so bitter when I lose

Defeat hurts, I got scissors in my shoes

And I'm dancin'

Never got the steps right

Loose, I never slept tight

But I'ma keep dancin'

I did a cannonball off the deep end, my boat was comin' to America

Pouch of fairy dust and a little poodle terrier

A silver Derringer, a smile for the camera 

Split your line up like James Farrior

I've always been a cowboy, they need me like the cancer cure

Weed loud as crowd noise, we just let the amber burn

Wiffle Balls, child's toys, ain't fuckin' with amateurs

I'm Ken Griffey on the Mariners

Okay I'm way beyond the boundaries, outside of parameters

The rap chancellor, jacket made of camel fur

And Clockwork got every single answer 'cept time

I've experienced every feelin' except fine

I'm line dancin' again"
22,Aquarium,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-aquarium-lyrics,Watching Movies With the Sound Off,True,"Can you feel it?

Don't answer that, that was a rhetorical question

 rhetorical 

Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process

And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex

Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be

But can't you see? This angel speaks

She's saying the place is safe for me

I told ""wait for me,"" the make believer normally disguise

Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs

The morning rises and I'm fast asleep

Somewhere off in the master suite

Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks

My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther

When I'm sleep walking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker

A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter

The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these primadonnas

I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago

I like to toy with the idea that we really know

Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?

In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings

I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go

I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?

I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes

Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes

Take me away girl, somewhere they won’t be

Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak

Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

I'm just trying to make it all make sense

As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of

All the time “we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium

America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up

We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria

Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death

Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest

Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages

Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes

We all in search for substance, that drugs you pain and numbness

Circumstances advance the second chances for this beloved

I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming

But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend

Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained

Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days

Life, it works in such mysterious ways

All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say

I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go

I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?

I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes

Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes

Take me away girl, somewhere they won’t be

Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak

Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

Wherever my mind goes

I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes

Wherever your mind goes

Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes

I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes

Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes

I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes

Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

Yeah, can I get the littlest bit of reverb on my voice?

I'm trying to hide from something, I just don't know what

Oh, it's not sad baby, you know

Yeah, um, I saw a mountain, you know across the horizon

When I got there realized it was just a pile of rocks

Yeah, so God damn

I wonder if everybody hope

That this song is not depressing as the last one was

Cause Heaven smell like Nag Champas

Come here darling, ash my blunt 

Waiting on hallucination, ain't a single fact I trust 

Dear family, my sanity go down when my cash go up

Rap too much, how the fuck to get through the verse

I came from house parties

Find a bitch and go through her purse

All I need is a little good pussy and whole lot universe

I met God before I ever stepped into a church

And that motherfucker still owe me money

Ohhh I need a religion to follow

I swear to God that I got more problems

Than there is bitches in Carlow

Lord have Murciélago, yeah

To look into my parents eyes when I'm scared to die

My eyes same color as a cherry pie

Just make sure handle your business

A criminal leave no witness

And don't ever trust these bitches

What happened to your life when your house become a home

Where your children at? Where your children at?

You got two sons, all they do is fight

You up through the night like gimme-gimme-gimme that

Yeah, nice titties, got a pic, go and send me that

Sendak books, can you give her that?

Fuck rap, make a million off a shitty app

Yeah, smoke trees in the cab

Pittsburgh, show you where the city at

And don't forget that H, get you smacked in your face

Got so many sons, I was young, now they half my age

90K out in Portugal, smile on my face, backlit stage

My bitch batshit crazy and that shit fascinates me

Yeah, on my tongue where the tab is

And it burn like battery acid

I was in the backs of my classes

By the kids having asthma attacks

Cause he panicked every single time he sat on his glasses

Every Wonderland have a Alice

I'm demanding the truth, put your hands to the roof

Be a man, that's a challenge

Ascension

Ooh, I ain't a doctor, could you be a little patient?

Yeah, be a little patient

Everything will be okay then, if you be a little patient

One world, one nation, done waiting

Yeah, yeah, um

Now I'm still sipping moonshine

We discovered a new high, me and Jerm done this a few times

Yeah, but who's high now

Talk a lot of shit but will you die now

What you gonna do when everybody die out, just go die out

Let's ride out"

Lord, I want a fair one with my demons

Karen Meyers became married to Jesus

Born dead, they had to dig up my fetus

And now the devil want to tear me to pieces

I'm a diagnosed insomniac

An astronaut who blasted off into the stars galactic

On top of Saturn, fox-trotting with Velociraptors

The dino-aliens invaded Earth, so they could feed on hypochondriacs

Preparing for the rapture, closet hillbilly threw the spinners on the tractor

I listen to Uncle Kracker

But, that's white America for you, we all that matters

I'm walking backwards, shadowboxing with karate masters

It's more to rap, we sell the royal crack at Castle Rock

A bad apple like an unemployed Macintosh

We lost Jobs

Now they brainwashed with dot com

It's only so long before we surrender the free world to Hong Kong

And sinners stay still, but the merry go round, and round

It all just keeps spinning

Gotta keep swimming

Eat drink and let the merry go round

Eat drink and let the merry go round

I got a double sided silver dollar

Larry Fish here from midget league, beginner slaughter

I'm not drowning, I'm waiting in the water

Killing off these monsters ever since I was a Sabra

I got horses on my PJ's

Shout to spitta jet life, I fit the Porsches on the PJ's

On stage, sending dark forces to my DJ

The birdies on tour like PGA

Davis love the third, Pittsburgh warrior

Bullets in my cornea

In exelsis Deo, ayo, this is Gloria

Ave, Ave Maria, I'm getting bread, yeast rise on Easter

Money is God

Black beaches with jungle fever I love to be on

You on the B-Team I fuck with Solange

All my life they said I doesn't belong

So I'm chilling, growing drugs on my lawn

And centers stay still, but the merry go round, and round

It all just keeps spinning

Gotta keep swimming

Eat drink and let the merry go round

Eat drink and let the merry go round

Yeah, what what

Have you found a way out?

Have you found a way out?

Vacation in Slovakia, celebrating Mardi Gras

Eating baklava and lobster claw at the Ramada

With Mafia immigrants

Finna take 'em on a pilgrimage

Have you found a way out?"

Look, concoction of hamentashens, launching a bottle rocket 

Done being nice, I'm here for your life and all the profits 

I'm not your conscience, you nuts? Almonds and Häagen-Dazs

Auction off your grandfather's watch from the Holocaust

I'm iconic, naked walking in the garden and bird watching

Alarming all of these cardinals like I need a pope 

Puffing that white smoke , get faded and play the maestro

I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe 

Sneaky bitch stole my Rollie last night, yo

I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though 

Walking on a tight rope, underneath a microscope

But close up, we all just molecules and isotopes 

What psychic don't know the future?

To live life, you kids might just close your computer 

The street lights might blind you though 

Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope

There's a bird, in the sky

Look at him fly, why?

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why

Let the money pile, I'll be running wild

Life's a mothafuckin' joke so we fuck around

Feel like I do this in my sleep

Literally, I do this in my sleep

It's an impression of Bueller

Yeah, yeah, a little TV money , dollars for sense of humor 

Scholar but my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor

Some cold brews in the cooler 

Coming through in the wood grain PT Cruiser, stunting

I'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom 

Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes 

Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude 

And I was raised better, say God bless you 

I'm Kenny Powers, you're more of a Debbie Downer

My bitch taking off her trousers every time I get around her

I'm nasty, I never shower, go sleep on a bed of flowers

Not into this conversation, I've been in my head for hours

I'm out

There's a bird, in the sky

Look at him fly, why?

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why

Let the money pile, I'll be running wild

Life's a mothafuckin' joke so we fuck around

Feel like I do this in my sleep

Literally, I do this in my sleep"

My engineer gettin' paid off

Rock like ASAP, light the weed and take off

So high I cannot see, Adolf

Now I got these rappers all breakin up a sweat

Cause everytime I get up on the mic I come correct

And I learned it from the best, always dressed in something fresh

Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest

Yes, they heard I used to rock guess

But now I'm rocking clothes that ain't in the stores yet

Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex

Trying to make it work out think I need more reps

Used to take the bus now the boy board jets

Cause kids got me buzzing like a fucking hornet

They say I got next, tell em that I got now

It's all Disney, boy my family proud

Make 'em say ow, make 'em say oh

The hoes that tell me yes, the same ones that tell ya no

Whoa, I ain't just an average joe

Way above the average flow, boy my life is most dope

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile

Pursuit to be happy only laughing like a child

I never thought life would be this sweet

It got me cheesing from cheek to cheek

And I ain't get away for nothing cause that just ain't my style

Life couldn't get better, this gon' be the best day ever

If it ain't about the dream, than it ain't about me

Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep

Imagination, making, musical creation

The journey that I'm facing plus the paper that I'm chasing

Got me crazy after sane with the lames I see you hating

But there's nothing that can change it, thumbs up I'm maintaining

No complaining when it's raining, I'll be in another zone

Move out my mothers home to a world I call my own

I ain't gonna play around no more

Find the difference from the ground and the floor

If we gotta fight, I'll be down for the war

Thumbs up, homie I'll be sure

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile

Pursuit to be happy only laughing like a child

I'm chilling for an hour, smoking weed, watching Worldstar

Benz in the garage, probably got to drive your girl car 

You ain't a rapper if my homies never heard y'all

I just spit a punchline, smile then they bird call 

Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball 

I'm dealing with some shit that really don't concern y'all

Punch a fan if you get a fucking word wrong

I'm wavy, giving you some shit that you can surf on 

Finding me a bitch I can swerve on 

Frank Thomas homie, 'bout to put the hurt on 

Your bitch a night light in bed, she turned on

Roll some weed, tell her burn one

Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one

Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one

Yea, I used to give a fuck about success

Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress

Hope she down for buttsex, it would be a cum fest

Sorry, that's some shit I had to confess

Crazy-ass bitch doing 911 threats

Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds

Now I'm at the top and the crown fit, gold on my outfit

Surrounded by this pussy, I'mma drown in it

Got that wet pack, bitch come and give me that 

You know we want to know where them titties at 

Got 'em gassed, they be asking what I'm cooking with

Have your little brother ask your moms what a pussy is?

Corruption, stunting at the function

Your girl pussy smell like Sour Cream & Onion 

Pay attention, you'll learn something

Roll that weed up, burn one

Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one

Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one"

Kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock

It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop

Louis shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit

Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it

No clue what I'm callin' my album

Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm

Never knew the outcome be this much cash now

Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house

Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about

Be varying from politics to bitches pullin' asses out

That's exactly how I do this as a rapper

I'm nuttin' in her mouth you tongue kissin' her after

Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered

But they also want the kid to cum right on their cooter

Have the music soundin' better than guitar tuners

Plus I'm doing shows daily call me John Stewart

So who you know that's iller than Mac Miller and company

It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree

Now I got a hundred g's so none of y'all can fuck with me

Yeah I said it publically so run and tell your mother, motherfucker

I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker

Hold up Jerm let me spit the second

Hey yo I breeze past haters in the E-class quickly

In deep, did a hundred songs and that’s this week

Shit keeps goin' on and on

We just tryna go bananas like it's Donkey Kong

Yeah, on my grind, always need to work

So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt

If you talkin' shit, you gonna see me smirk

While the DJ be scratchin' til the needles burst

A couple screws probably loose in my head

Holla at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed

I'm a regular guy with an irregular life

Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racin' a bike

Who knew that I can turn turn sound into somethin' so cool

Fresh kids, see me I'm bustin' the moves

Coming in soon to a theater near you

Creep in your kitchen start eating your food

Girls tryna fuck I don't be in the mood

No time for pussy when money in the room

Ohh, I switch flows switch rhythm

Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition

This is Blue Slide Park"

I play the keys you play the drums, ee do a little bass on this one

Ahhhh hey

Alright Alright Alright Alright

'92 til infinity and beyond

You're witnessing the gambles of infinity

Music in my soul on they go ain't getting rid of me

Peace and divinity in each and every inch of me

We living through this melody, you singing in a different key

See I'm nice with these rhymes, I might be blind

Just see inside of minds, I gets unkind

I'm like a physic; I don't give a fuck if you like this

We here to party, had a little music to turn up loud

'92 til infinity just some shit that you ain't heard in awhile

I don't give a fuck if there ain't a party

We got a little music to turn up loud

We different, got our life that we living standing out in the crowd

That boom bap rap, they ask me how I do it

I'm just cool like that

Alright alright alright alright

That boom bap rap

When they ask you what your doing tell em that you're cooling

Keepin it moving, ain't nothing new I'm a do what I do

Pullin' up in something that you haven't seen

Clean and accompained by one of the baddest queens

Peel the top back feeling superb as I pass the green

We just coolin' vibing without the magazine

Breezing through 376 thinking about my past ventures

Came from running, duckin' and jumping over fences

Used to play reckless trying to get the check

Stopped now it's visions with my camp from the triple deck yaught

I can't stop, won't stop I keep running

Unleash the beast, freak beats and keep coming

Nasty but we spit it so sincerly

Drip phlegm from the pen so they can feel me

Boom bap ones with the hip-hop

They say we different wonder how we do it but it's sealed in a ziplock

Killin' beats from '87 till the end of me

And Mac been involved since '92 until infinity

That boom bap rap, they ask me how I do it

I'm just cool like that

Alright alright alright alright

That boom bap rap

When they ask you what your doing tell em that you're cooling

Keepin it moving, ain't nothing new I'm a do what I do

This that boom bap shit, return of mister boom bapstic

Most dope making new classics

Screem beef dog, look lose that shit

You ain't built for contact better do glasses

Haters get mad my view zoom past em

You lose that bitch, you think local I do atlas

Vinny Radio do that shit

It's like bird flu how I move that sick – ness

Got my money looking healthy work to stretch it everyday we call it physical fit-ness

Made my name in the game from playing no games but giving these beats the bussi-ness

It's a guaranteed conviction everytime I kill a track I'm letting you all with-ness

We deserve a reward for bring back that boom bap rap that you Miss-in"

Woo, yeah, woo, yeah

Okay, okay, yeah, uh

We in between heaven and hell

Fuck a 9 to 5, I'd rather end up dead or in jail

American ninja to these obstacles

No stopping me, we on the move

Your mouth running like a prostitute's

Keep your head to yourself

I work harder than anybody you know

I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow

Deadly aim, self contained

Superstar, they yell the name

Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain

The P fitted on my head though

I'm too high, you can't reach me with the cell phone

No goodbyes, no hellos

You don't want this life I live

You'd rather had the wife and kid

Shooting dice with Jesus Christ, put 20 on the midnight

To everyone who sell me drugs

Don't mix it with that bullshit

I'm hoping not to join the twenty seven club

Just want the coke dealer house with the velvet rug

Fuck the world, there's no one else but us

Everything we think we love

It ain't nothing but a brand name

To everyone but us

It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name

Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name

Baby, this right here is hand made

I got brothers, I don't need no friends

My shoes off I'm comfortable, I'm chilling, smoking weed again

I'm from the 'Burgh, not the burbs

Investigating my nation, homie, we ain't concerned

Went from the 412 out to the 310

Went from the pavement in my basement to them yellow brick roads

See, I was on my Ps & Qs like L-M-N-O

But kicking bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em go home, I don't know

I was in the crib with my different shit

Simple living, I'm a hypocrite

Cause I'm filthy rich, I got businesses

Been had wifey's, have mistresses

Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listening

The war ain't winning, it just beginning

And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan

I got stats, they got opinions, I got facts

LeBron left home, but he came back

This what raised me, made me rap

PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately

See, I left and they call me shady

I'm a white rapper, they always call me shady

Got no idea what I'm contemplating, I guess

Everything we think we love

It ain't nothing but a brand name

To everyone but us

It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name

Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name

Baby, this right here is hand made

La, la, la, la

La, la, la, la

Dracula

It's the young miraculous, mister love-to-grab-his-nuts

Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura

Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous

Dinner with forty courses, bunch of horny whores and fornicate

To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses I am

My homies got my back, they all Verizon, man

I bring this to you like lalalalala-live man

You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance

The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates

Blowing smoke out the window

Cops out on patrol, they looking out for all the criminals

But now I walk around with money and my hand on my dick

I think I'm special

I'm drinking whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out

One million, two million, shit I'm losing track now

Coming to you live inside the crack house

Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce

Then I turned it to a pound, turned that to a house

Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here?

Spending all your time just getting high will drive you crazy

I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the 80's

Speeding down the freeway getting head in my Mercedes

Giving me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better

No pressure, dope seller, smarter than your professor

Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller

The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?

Shit I probably could've been the president

Cops out on patrol looking out for all the criminals

We went straight into the room

And played the music, started dancing

You was taking off your pants

It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore

I do you like a chore

We started on the bed and then we moved it to the floor

You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore

I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord

You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type

Now you always wanna spend the night

Now I'm doing everything you like

When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right

Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight

Pure bliss, I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive

Infatuation, when every single move you make is fascinatin'

Gravitatin' towards anything that gives a sense of happiness

Activist, love activeness

Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists

Hope you found what you lookin' for

I hope you found what you lookin' for

You take away the pain and I thank you for that

If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back

I'mma be waiting for that, I'mma be waiting for that

Misery—you represent love, you the epitome

So wish for me, I'll come out of nowhere—your epiphany

Disconnect from everybody

Who don't understand my vision yet

In a jet is where my mind is so I light another cigarette

To calm me down

So calm me down

Everybody who can save me now is not around, chopper down

Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?

In between, purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be

Live a dream, that's so cliché

But I can't tell you what it means to me

You take away the pain and I thank you for that

If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back

I'mma be waiting for that, I'mma be waiting for that

And so it is to the printing press...

To the recorder of man's deeds—the keeper of his conscience

—the courier of his news—that we look for strength and assistance—confident that with your help, man will be what he was born to be—free and independent..."

Sticking to my word, I'm Velcro hell No !

See the wordplay dance from his lips

All my ladies put ya hands on ya hips, here some candy to lick

Come and holla if ya man is a bitch

Every party that I roll to they demand me to spit

Treat me like I'm Peyton Manning in this

Playa I don't got no time for the slow grind here in 09'

Blow minds with these dope rhymes, call them coke lines

Snort it get distorted, I'm takin' you out of orbit

Plus we poppin' champagne see the cork twist

Hungry, feed it like my mother got four tits

Wolverine nails signin' on the X man

They don't hear me up in Def Jam"
54,Claymation,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-claymation-lyrics,Watching Movies With the Sound Off,True,"Bitches stay hating, this is Claymation

Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation

Want to get paid, who doesn't though?

I'mma be a ghost, take a polaroid picture

Fresh off a steroid swisher

Pistol at the peephole that's a paranoid nigga

One of a kind though, ain't nobody close to me

Your answers straight over G, I'll bag you like groceries

It's whatever though, whatever cross my mind

Haters got no watch, I ain't got the time

Vinny got more flow than a box of wine

Rare as a copper dime, I got an awkward mind

But it's beautiful, like Russel Crowe

Fire at the fingertips can't extinguish it

Shorty gave me tight head without shrinking it

Coolest kid out, on my Chuck Inglish shit

Mac and Vinny, always get the people loose

Fall back, strike back, just like evil do

The birds prey on us like eagles do

It's like claymation the way they bend and move

Bitches stay hating, this is Claymation

Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation

Want to get paid, who doesn't though?

I'mma be a ghost, take a polaroid picture

Monster and Michael Keaton, and I'm offing you while you sleep

And you talking but it's so cheap, and I'm popular for a reason

I got a pool but it's sharks swimming in the deep end

Don't get much sleep, two minutes and get a dream in

Is all you need, it's crazy

The colony was lost at sea getting wavy

The rawest rapper, baby forehead autographer

On top of Saturn, I'm sending shots from a rocket blaster

Believe me this is where geniuses live

It's Most Dope, we holier than all of Jesus' kids

But we speaking in heathens, and all of these Even Stevens

Who don't need a reason, just want a bitch they can feed with semen

No need for sleeping, Cheeba gon' keep me dreaming, I'm faded

Been in Cali a lil' too long it got me jaded

Hit Japan and I'm instagram camera shy Samurais

Fucking up a Jerm beat, teach you how to vandalize

The bandana Santana tied

The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom ride

My pockets fat I'm still looking for some pants my size

They over-analyze everything I fantasize

We could have a conversation, we could pantomime

Girl you could come a little closer, put your hand in mine

This life a prison, it's time to set you free

Watching movies in silence describing what I see

Bitches stay hating, this is Claymation

Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation

Want to get paid, who doesn't though?

I'mma be a ghost, take a polaroid picture"

Wanna let me cut, tell her ""line it up""

Little bit much, I'm a wild one

All I do is fuck hoes, drink tiger blood

Ever since I came in the game they been sour

I'm the plug, get your motherfuckin' power up

Couple keys of uncut cocaine on the wrist

And I let my nuts hang on a bitch

The money that we spend on champagne is ridiculous

And it is us, elixir in my cup

Give the bitches drugs, a dick to suck

And I don't see why these kids wanna grow up to be just like me

I was a nobody, now my name in they mouth

Came for a steak but I left with the cow

And they hate when you great though

Ain't shit change but my checking account

Oh my God! Hey

They always want that fun shit when you tryna spit a little somethin' real

They start runnin', turnin' chicken like a nugget meal

How the fuck I feel? Kinda like a hundred mill

Spun the wheel, bought a vowel, I don't owe you nothin' still

Fuck a deal, I can do it with my own team

Won before Sheen, hear how all these hoes scream

When I was 14, sippin' on my OE

Tryna marry money but that bitch kept gettin' cold feet

Music loud, hear it bangin' through the whole street

Beat gettin' shit on, toilet bowl seat

No sleep, just work

Got a couple horny girls in a see-through shirt

So believe my hype, muthafuckas can't read nor write

Still they talkin' shit man, I've seen your type

Got problems, can't sleep at night

Cause your girl want to come around freak all night

I'm a sex drill when I'm rollin' off them x pills

Five bikes, ten wheels, girl I'll leave your legs still

Say I don't do drugs, just weed

Well I'mma do drugs and speed down the street

Do doughnuts, your flow sucks, you so butt

Your girl's gettin' throat fucked, I get high, I go up

Why you sayin' that he's a trend?

Then come to all those shows just to meet your friends?

So much coke sniffed, fuckin' hoes with bloody noses

Just a couple doses, fuck the roses

Class time, better take good notes

You bitches couldn't touch me with a Facebook poke

58,Colors And Shapes,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-colors-and-shapes-lyrics,Faces,True,"If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary

Instead of all of this weight that we have to carry

Would you be able to breathe?

And if you could just find where that comfort resides

No distraction or movement that fucks with your mind

Would you let them see?

While beneath the ocean I met with the captain

Who sank to the floor on his ship

All of his passengers escaped to safety

But he was not done with his trip

He looked up and smiled, asked me ''how do you do?''

I told him I'm losing my grip

He told me ''son, if you want to hold onto yourself

Then let yourself slip''

Fall

Ooh

Fall

Oh

Fall

Oh, it feels good to fall

These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures

Of something that'll they understand

They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty

But march on the heart of this land

Oh oh, why don't you turn around and go home?

They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense

These things that a man doesn't need

Take out the love and the passion and hope

And they fill it with nothing but greed

While floating through galaxies they said I couldn't

I noticed how sad one can get

Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful I find

I can't understand nothing no more

If I jump let me fall

If I jump let me fall

Fall

Ooh

Fall

Oh

Fall

Oh, it feels good to fall

Think for yourself

Don't accept something because an authority tells you to"

And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers

We could be friends

I just need a way out of my head

I'll do anything for a way out

Of my head

In my own way, this feel like living

Some alternate reality

And I was drowning, but now I'm swimming

Through stressful waters to relief

Yeah, oh, the things I'd do

To spend a little time in Hell

And what I won't tell you

I'll prolly never even tell myself

And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right

When you inside all day

I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain

Grey skies, I'm drifting, not living forever

They told me it only gets better

My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send

And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers

We could be friends

I just need a way out of my head

I'll do anything for a way out

Am I supposed to? Okay... love

Love, love, love, love, love 

Love, love, love, love, love, love, love 

This sun don't shine when I'm alone

I lose my mind and I lose control

I see your eyes look through my soul

Don't be surprised, this all I know

I felt the highs and they felt like you

See a love like mine is too good to be true

And you too divine to just be mine

You remind me of the color blue

Girl I'm so in love with you, yeah

Girl I'm so in love with you

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Um, well, baby

You were everything I ever wanted

Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket

Planned to ask the other day

Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it

Remember when you went away to college

Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'

Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn

Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'

Feelings that we have are so alarmin'

I can make you laugh, I can break the glass

If we made it last, it'd be a bargain

Mr. Charmin', that is my department

You was there before the fancy cars and

You was there when I was just a starvin' artist

When the car was havin' trouble startin'

Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail

Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale

And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale

I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed

You said ""All you ever think about is sex""

I'm like, ""Oh well, you know me so well

And if this will make you late, I swear, I won't tell

And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell

I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail""

Well, I'm the jealous type

But I swear that ass what Heaven's like

When I'm in that pussy, it's a better life

That's the only way I'm tryna end the night

That's my only chance, I better get it right

Take your time, my baby

Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you

I know I make your mind go crazy

Cause I'm waitin' right here for you, for you

You get closer with, run away

All I ever known is the color gray

Your loveliness bring me sunshine

I found an angel so divine

Heaven probably not the same without you

But now you're in my world, in my world

Ahhhh, ahhhh

Ahhhh, ahhhh"

Tryna slander my name but when you sit think about it

It's hard to show off your aim when niggas yet to see the target

My trees rolled, beauty of the week is foreign

And my homie bought a yacht so we on it and drinks are pourin'

Hoes admire my clothes cause I got Louis features on 'em

Life just like a movie plus the special features bonus

With bad bitches and good weed to keep us coughin'

Hard as a bed of nails you a beast for sleeping on 'em

I got these motherfuckers hatin' on the way the boy live

Angry at the way they ladies always say that I'm the shit

People stay up on my dick, I ain't worried bout them

I'm to focused on the money, I ain't worried bout friends

They say the youngin' dream like a king

I'm Muhammad Ali in the ring, Christmas Eve in the spring

Way above the bar, but I ain't 21

Wizzle cuttin' up cause I stay puffin' blunts

And when the money come, I'mma give it back

Got a driver who addresses me as Mr. Mac

Dealing with these diva hoes, they so demanding

Mac a young superstar, Dakota Fanning

And you know I'm planning for the world to be mine

No blind dates, but I'm hittin' girls from behind

The type of shine stay turnin' 'em blind

I'm psychopathic, low key, my hyperactive dome piece

Get no sleep, ill as fuck, the hospitals seem so weak

I stood before an Angel as he told me bout the glory

Put me in a room of people, how the fuck could I be lonely?

I only get money, these labels tryna clone me

Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete

So, I try to keep 'em in my head

It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead

Word to Heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass

Life is good sometimes, but it just doesn't last

A bunch of stress, you see this mic is like my punching bag

Rock 'n' roll, drugs and cash, you softer than a bubble bath

Sucka ass mothafucka, mothafucka's sediment

That's a strike but fuck bowling, I could tear a pin of Maryland

See, I'm American, apparently it's damaging

To be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn

Monroe, looking dumb hoes who want to much dough

And come close to have you straight tripping when you jump rope

Don't rock the love boat, this business fucking cut throat

And it's gonna crack if you just paint the wall with one coat

Rooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog

These rappers who be hating probably need to get a job

See, me I'm with my squad, getting money, living comfortable

I know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though

Fuck a toast, y'all is fucking broke, cut ya throat

Judging me is nothing dope, boy you lying under oath

God made the world, why did man make the scriptures?

And if he created Lennon, why'd he go and make a Hitler?

I could take a photo, but I'd rather paint a picture

Of the one Laurence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters

I'm from Pittsburgh, that's black and gold

If my skin gets filled up, I'mma tat my soul

Running out of paper, writing on my hand

Hundred thousand haters writing 'bout my jams

Want a number one independent album? I'm your man

I'mma hit Preme and leave you all right where you stand

Are the fires of hell aflowing?

Is the grizzly reaper mowing?

Yes!

The danger must be growing for the rowers keep on rowing, and they're certainly not showing any signs that they are slowing!

Ahhh!

Make it stop daddy!

We're there

But hurry please, we have so much time and so little to see, wait a minute scratch that, reverse it, thank you"
79,Diablo,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-diablo-lyrics,Faces,True,"Yeah, yeah, yeah

Rap diablo

Yeah, yeah

It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows

Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo

Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono

Rappin' head honcho, rocking shows like I was Bono

I go play a couple keys on the piano

The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow

Follow me I could show you where we be's at

How'd I get my g pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax

These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap

Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at

The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em

Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium

Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human

I'm amphibian, fake superhero like the Mystery Men

I ain't saving nothin'

I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels come and skippin' all the famous functions

How do the famous function? The A list can't be trusted

I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet

The bottom barrel of society, I tell my bitch

If she don't love me then just lie to me, I'm finer than the winery

Take it from the rich, this is piracy 

Finally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see

Come and die with me

'Cause everybody got dead homies 

Said everybody got dead homies 

Yeah, said everybody got dead homies 

Said everybody got dead homies 

Yeah, um

Okay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah

These other rappers just a diet soda

I find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements

This a marathon gentlemen, go 'head and start the races

Save the coffin spaces

You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin' now you on vacation

Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas

Lava makin', so hot I'm turning hog to bacon

Only God can save 'im, I heard the monsters made 'im

I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations

Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD

Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be

You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks

Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke

Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete

Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history

Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me

Runnin' to the underworld with guns and set the sinners free

No bitches in my circle, I'ma show you the commercial

I've been popping like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal

Treat you like a urinal

'Cause everybody got dead homies 

Said everybody got dead homies 

Yeah, said everybody got dead homies 

Said everybody got dead homies "

She want to hit the beach, and show her titties down in Key West

Someone leave her crying all the time and now she finally out of Kleenex

Sick of dudes not givin' her the respect

Cause really she a genius, a CEO

Tryin' to be on top alone, she don’t keep them close

She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss

Tough bitch, probably would’ve thought she played lacrosse

Sick of bein' soft with her heart broken all the time

Want some money too, fuckin' dudes

And falling all in love with who, was nothin' new

Only coming through to bust a nut or two

She just need her family like the Huxtables

And now she on the road, left them home to takeover

Get rich and have her crib made over

But she gonna do it partyin', with her cup full

Ain’t gonna trust you, but she gonna fuck you

She wants diamonds, she wants gold

But she’s scared to let you get too close

And she’s been high and she’s been low

But now she finally on her own

And they’ve been looking

So they been finding

Cause she ain’t runnin'

And she ain’t hiding

Until she finds her place back home

And then she’s finally all alone

She gonna be rich, as fuck

In high school they were callin' her a slut

But now she coming up, Louis Vuitton and Juicy on her butt

See the bitches that be hatin' like “What’s up?”

Cause they ain’t doing nothing and she out here stuntin'

Middle finger to them hoes, all them bitches had it comin'

Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down

Invite you to the crib, let you look around

Just a fuckin' tease, tryna get your cheese

Invite you out to dinner, cause she want to eat for free

She could pay it if she wanted to, she won’t though

Go home, she got more dough

She wants diamonds, she wants gold

But she’s scared to let you get too close

And she’s been high and she’s been low

Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally

Hopefully I'll be at the top soon

For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons

You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance

Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion

But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it

‘Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish

I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass

Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed

That's the way it goes when you party just like I do

Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit

Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent

I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it

Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend

And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen

Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend

And if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10

I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky

When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit

Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

Ladies tryna text me, saying that they home for the summer

And they heard that I'm living on my own

So they wanna come to the crib, maybe cook me some supper

But I'm busy, so I'm ignoring her

Other fools homo, Roy and Siegfried

No disrespect though

I got addictive cigarette flow for the green pesto, presto

I'd like to make myself believe

That planet earth turns slowly

It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

Cause everything is never as it seems

Me, I'm highly underestimated

So educated in getting paid quick

If you ever hated, anticipate that I'm famous

Got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with

Celebrate that we seeing another day, life good

Never wanna end this

Me and Mary Jane got a really nice friendship

Yeah they give me money but I gotta go and spend it

Man, I been a bad little jew

But I gotta pay the bills now so I gotta chill out

I ain't walking 'round like I'm splurging with a mill now

Feel like the kid working at the mill now

Used to just chill and smoke joints up at Bill's house

Now I gotta schedule, things I gotta do

Doing interviews, see it up on YouTube

I say it feels just like a dream

'bout to wake up from a nap

How fucked up was that?

Like

I'd like to make myself believe

And you know I've been through all the highs

I've seen all the lows, lost track of time

Travel navigation, I switch up my location

Day goin' without shavin', the road life's a bitch

So, for no life, I'd switch

Got my money comin' faster than these women I get into

Can't tell me how to live my life

Chill fool, I been cool

Pretty cool, kinda nice, not rude

Get front row then show their boobs

Party every night, they worry that I blow the fuse

When the life around you changes try to keep your sameness

Try to keep your brain maintainin' through the lameness

Sometimes I just wanna go

Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home

I'm so close but they don't know

Got some freaky hoes and weed to blow

Rock the cleanest clothes

My life different from every single kid you know

Places I go out on my own

Hoes stay blowing up my phone

But, I wanna be left alone

Doing shows, hitting four, five cities in a row

Hit me with some dough, cause they know I'm 'bout to blow

You can always say no if you wanna lay low

Girl, you look so good you need to get up on the floor

Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?

I feel so fly and I hope you can relate

I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee

It's the same old dude but a brand new me

I've been up and I've been down

Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around

But, I'm just another face in the crowd

I said, ""I'm just another face in the crowd""

They tell me it's impossible to do it, I'd be stupid if I tried

But I'm using a maneuver, keep on moving 'em aside

I'm just trying to make some music for the ride

Listen to it when you drive, destination you arrive

Russell Crow, just a beautiful mind

Got talent, imagine what I'll do with some time

I'm giving you a high feeling, moving your spine

Usually, find me chilling up in Jupiter

I'm so happy when you mad, Khakis, let 'em sag

Mom says ""You could see my ass"" and she laughed

Blindfolded on the turnpike, hoping I don't crash

Stashing the weed under the passenger seat

Hope these sixteen wheelers don't crash into me

People taking pictures when I pass in the street

Zoom by, don't fasten my seatbelt

And now you know how we felt

Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?

I feel so fly and I hope you can relate

I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee

It's the same old dude but a brand new me

Only down one, I'm in the final shooting threes

Like I don't give a fuck, music we fuck and switch the position up

We love the things that keep on bringin' out the kids in us

Been workin' all my life to do some different stuff

And people have the nerve to say I'm young and haven't lived enough

I'm on the road, my girl so sad I'm gone

It's hard when I can't even find the time to call my mom

And she thinks I'm goin' Hollywood, I guess she probably should

It seems like people see the bad and don't acknowledge good

I feel the shade, but I can see the sun, I'm cool

I've got the time, but feel the need to run

A fool

Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb

Been spendin' cake to get some bump in the trunk

Drums with a pump

Like some Reeboks, see me from the treetops

They worry, but they need not, heatin' like a teapot

Now I think I'm cool cause I got a pair of shoes

And mo' dough, a jacket with a Polo logo

My cup always filled with Henny, so no Fo' Loko

But they should know, so

I could go slow

You see that I'm smooth, now

Used to ignore me, they study what I do now

With some help from Kweli, and it's Like on the Beat

It's cool to say that my cypher complete

Word

I'm so sick with the verbs I use, the words that heal us

They love how I kill it on stage, man, Murder theaters

No wonder they call it a bunk, I sleep in a coffin

Dead tired, exhausted from how often I be touring

So gangsta, like the occupation of Made Men

Creatin' chaos, my operation is Mayhem

The movie never stopped, the frame change over

We added Mac to the wolfpack, Hangover

That Hen is not a friend, I'm on that Lagavulin

Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man

You're not a kid no more, no one to hold your hand

And Four Loko make you shoulder lean like a Dro fan

Go ham, like Abraham readin' all the Psalms

Oh yeah, and don't forget to call your moms

Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of

You a waste of the space that you take up

Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'

I had an intuition about these women

And suspicion got me lookin' at you different

How a man in my position can't start slippin' down these slopes

'Cause it's all just 

As a kid I didn't learn that, but 

When you a youngin

You just tryna live your life and have some fun

In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become

It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one

And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs

I'm a Beatle to these young kids

But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids

You had the world, you about to leave it to these young kids

And we gonna show you what the love is...

Stay high, go for what you know

Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go

It won't stop!

You can't fight the feeling, no 

You can't fight the feeling, feeling

You can't fight the feeling, no

So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene

We stay smokin' through the night wake up, do some tai-chi

Homie can't you see I'm chillin? Please don't fuck up my chi

Yeah my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion

Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of sastisfaction

Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan

Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon

A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams

A price on an idea, we never can agree

They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe

So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?

Still I tell em, ""Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable""

Just continue livin' life, cause enough of 'em don't

You spent your days countin' every single penny made

Restart now, cause we comin' for you anyways

Stay high, go for what you know

You can't fight the feeling, no

I told you it won't stop cause

You can't fight the feeling, feeling

You can't fight the feeling, no

Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up

Wipe the smudge of makeup off my bed

Soon as she’s gone and take up

Hours out my day just to find power shit to say

But you won't hear it

Even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre

I mean the sun is slowly falling, we all surely should die eventually

So what's your calling? Oh you left your phone behind?

Identity crises break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness

Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent

Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless

My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open

Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme, choking

Or soaking up game, I'm hoping you picked the second one

Change the emotion of jealousy that you're holding

You're telling me that you're golden but really cubic zirconia

Let me see, I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever

Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you Mayweather, you

You can't fight the feeling, feeling

You can't fight the feeling, no 

You can't fight the feeling

You can't fight the feeling, no"

Baby girl I don't wanna be your man, but let me just write my number on your hand

At the party with a whole bunch of honeys here

You got your Forces laced up with some bunny ears

Your looking right and he ain't here tonight so

I won't tell him if you don't OHHH!

So let's roll, roll back to the crib

Grey Goose, lights dimmed, girl that's how I live

You know you got them kicks, fat ass, and some lips

Baby you ain't gotta ask for a kiss

Shorty look proper, with kicks like Foot Locker

All done up, she a good shopper

New jeans, blue tee, and her shoes clean

Looking like she 'bout to seduce me

Just touch me, tease me, cute caressin'

100 thousand pairs in your shoe collection

I know you like to tell, but let me just lay back while you light my L

So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around

I'm just foolin around, I'm just foolin' around

Alright, look at when I come around and spit that flow

3 in a row, no Tic-tac-toe, hit that Dro, get so blowed

Hold up and spit that slow, oo I'm high 

Ya'll hatin', you gon' stop, I'm comin' to your block

Still hear my music knock

Gon' take this to the top, I want the top spot

Spittin' them pop rocks, the human talk box

I'm top notch and you ain't got a fan yet

Watch me blow they minds with some bars, call me Xanax

I ain't even goin' hard, told you my flow is sharp

And when the Dro is sparked, sittin' back Rosa Parks

Don't call me lazy, I ain't just some bum kid

But I can bust wigs with every single drum kit

I like to joke a lot, I'm....... I'm not

My moms is walkin' in the room ""like are you smokin' pot?""

Blow the smoke out like yes I am

So can I mothafuckin' kick this? yes you can

Rdin' round, tryna get this money right

Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type

So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around

I'm just foolin around, I'm just foolin' around"

My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you

Well my crew too live but I ain’t Uncle Luke

And I ain’t no hipster, but girl I can make your hips stir

From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher

Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles

Looking out my monocle

I’m dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio

You cock-a-roach, I’m heroin cause everything I talk is dope

Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop & Glo

Tryin’ to get a mansion ain’t nobody here gon' find my room

Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my slide stay blue

So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template

The next day these losers always goin’ with whats trendy

My pen game is something these motherfuckers have never seen

All City Champion everybody is second string

No need to testify for the best is I 

And anybody in my way goin’ to be left to die

I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab

Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back

Anything you need you can find it at the market

If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch

I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab

Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back

Anything you need you can find it at the market

Anything you need you can find it at the market

I got my own stickers now so literally I’m everywhere

Hundred different shoes still feel the need to cop a fresher pair

These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year

Fool you better get prepared

Don’t know ‘bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here

Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage

Sick bars I’ve been a boss so stick around and watch it

Didn't fit around no college campus, chilling writing on top of planet Earth

Fuck who's first, It’s just bout who the hardest

On my own two, fuck who's saying different

Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling

I’m the starter you the fill in

You a martyr I’m just killing

Getting harder with each time I write

Wish I could rewind last night

I had so much fun just kickin’ it and goin’ in

Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn’t fuckin’ know me then

And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend

You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in

I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab

Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back

Anything you need you can find it at the market

If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch

I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab

Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back

Anything you need you can find it at the market

Anything you need you can find it at the market

Yeah

Okay, okay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay

Okay, okay, yeah, um

Snowflakes keep falling on my expired debit cards

Don't know why I'm still awake, I gotta be up at 10 tomorrow

Missiles in my repertoire, I'd say I'm pretty reg—ular

I never leave my house, I don't know why I got an extra car 

My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks

And everyday it's full of jokers like a deck of cards 

Swear, I'm so lonely, there's horns on my dome-piece 

But, I'm not the devil, I'm a motherfucking Minotaur

Oh my God, look at how upset you are

Cause we out here winning, brought my dogs from out the reservoir 

And I'mma let 'em bark, before you ready, my set will start

We forgot our roots before and trust me, things they fell apart

Wash myself with acid, it's because I got a denim heart

My conscious so weak I need to split it up in 7 parts 

Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time

Went to Amar'e's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart 

But Kevin don't remember that

I saw him at the V-M-A's, told a joke - he never laughed 

The rap diablo, free your mind my motto

And we all gonna be good if TreeJ ever hit the lotto 

So arigato, so shit, you know I'm world famous

And R. Kelly been told me I'm the world's greatest 

But still to fall in love is like an orgasm

Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it

I'm always faded, getting shaded in the basement

I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it 

Thank God that I made it , ask Q where Dave is 

He'll probably tell you that he's rolling midnights out in Vegas 

Me I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent

Wear a suit to cash a check, we're going to the banquet 

And Jimmy got the burner, but he don't wanna murder

And Clockwork somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like

That man must be a alien, I really can't explain it, shit

It's just a little cocaine sniff 

But the lines is longer than parades is 

I think it's time to give me all your praises 

So I can get this money and give all the homies raises 

My life is on these words, this is my affidavit

And if you wanna legal battle, send your ass to David 

I'm half man-half amazing

Probably half God, but that don't fit my calculations 

I know the planet Earth is about to explode

Kinda hope that no one save it, we only grow from anguish

Yeah, Miller Mac, Miller Mac, haha, yeah Miller Mac, these are my friends Miller Mac

There's snowflakes falling on my debit card

Swear I'm not alive, I couldn't tell you if we ever are

In this Game of Thrones, it is known I got the 4G

LTE connection bars, no control, fuck Ken Lamar 

I don't vote, I never registered

But I'm a magnet for them zeros call me Edward Sharpe 

I wake up feeling dead, I need a fresher start

So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember

Smiled as I saw Jerm, nerding out with Josh Berg

Talking interlocutor, and drinking Arnold Palmer

In the other room, watching C-Span with E. Dan

Laying down the baseline, doing drums with his free hand 

When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican

My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows

I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids

But the lady said my hair was too short though, , man

I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit

Driving through the hood she did not have a reaction 

With a 6-year-old she kept the doors unlocked

And drove by the 5-0 like “fuck those cops!”

God damn, it just don't stop 

I know my father probably wish I would just smoke pot 

My grandma probably slap me for the drugs I got 

I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks

Yea, I've had the same outfit for 6 days straight 

And still, all these bitches will get in position

Because I got their pussies all dripping in paint

Somehow, I'm making this music it's just to relate to

And I got the life raft, ain't gonna save you

Look at my reflection, I broke the mirror

It's only for protection , shit keep getting weirder 

Now I can't see a thing but, things never been clearer

Call the Mothman it's Richard Gere 

This is our year

Let's get fucked up and get the fuck up outta here 

I've kicked it with the aliens, a different stratosphere 

And looking down like we come in peace 

I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit 

We on the same trip, we just got different baggage 

Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dad's shit 

We were just some motherfuckin' kids

If everything was gone tomorrow, who would miss it?

And if I pack my bags and moved away, who would visit?

If you knew what you should say who would listen

Yeah I'm talkin' bout a new religion

Somethin' to feed off, we searchin' for it like groups of pigeons

Kinda futuristic, yeah it's cool, we different

Cause what I do's terrific, I'm just hopin' you could feel it

Yeah, so tell me if you can, are you numb enough? Can you listen in?

I will lose it all to show 'em I'll get rich again

But matter fact, fuck that, cause I don't give a damn

You see it's simple when it's only cigarillos

In the world, no one should feel you, don't expect it from a little man

Fuck empty, my glass is filled

Countin' roses, daises and daffodils

Chill

Get ya money, fuck 'em all

Everything, could be gone tomorrow

What's if it's gone tomorrow?

Get ya money, fuck 'em all

Get ya money, fuck 'em all

Everything, could be gone tomorrow

Everything, could be gone tomorrow

So get ya money, fuck 'em all

I say my prayers, but I don't know who they to

Layin' on my back, lookin' through the roof

Just tell me, am I gettin' through to you?

Stickin' to it, super glue it, make it beautiful

Fuck, what am I missin'? Speak to your soul so, shut up and listen

Gimme a reason to pop, gettin' me goin', ain't lettin' me stop

Head to the top, it's better they not, call me a phony, so they sendin' me shots

I, got a girl, we in love, she my money, she my drugs

This my pain, this my pleasure, last forever, keep me up

Late at night, tell me it's alright, I believe her

I don't question she who knows me best, I know you wouldn't either

Somethin' happen when I see her, it's right out of a fairy tale

Got some shit you going through it's something that she handle well

Life a bitch but she my bitch

Gold rollie and it's timeless

We all wanna know what to do in this world

When it seems that there's nothing left

And we dream just to dream

But we don't know exactly how to get there yet

And we all wanna know what to do in this world

When it seems that there's nothing left

And we dream just to dream

But we don't know exactly how to get there yet"

When they supposedly die

It's this passage around the great loop""

Yeah, yeah, can you turn up my headphones?

Yeah, yeah, yeah

This music go with my funeral, yeah, yeah

Music go with my funeral, a-hem, yeah, I said

Said I was raised inside this gritty city, riding through, you probably miss me

My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me

All this sins be more than shitty, I just pray the lord forgive me

Doing drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me

My side-bitch is sort of pretty but she got enormous titties

Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley

Had a few abortions, unfortunately, I forced them

Lord knows I turn a child to an orphan when I'm touring

I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be

Sit at home and drink by myself, my thoughts harassing me

Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't getting back to me

A shame that my tragedy my masterpiece, yeah

Trapped inside these dreams of mine

Just trying to get some peace of mind, yeah

I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine

So you'll never get a piece of mind

This the last day 

Of my life 

Party like it's the last day 

Of your life 

This the motherfucking last day 

Of my life 

Party like it's the last day 

Of your life 

Yeah, yeah

See we swallowed in this web of lies, never tried to exercise

You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised

I heard the legends never died, oh this lonely hell of mine

There never was a better time to better myself

Forever I melt, and float away like waves in the ocean

Staring inside of Heaven's eyes, the gates will never open

I'm smoking on this field of hope, waiting 'til my deal gets closed

I keep getting hotter but all I seem to feel is cold

22 don't feel so old, but I think I'm 82

You mean to tell me God took seven days and all he made was you?

I'm out here with the kangaroos, making danger, break the rules

Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused

Happiness I take from you, searching for the naked truth

I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you

Bitch, check out the butterfly

If you the truth then what the fuck am I?

Yeah

This the last day 

Of my life 

Party like it's the last day 

Of your life 

This the motherfucking last day 

Of my life 

Party like it's the last day 

Of your life

Where are you headed?

Where are you going?

Can I come? Can I come?"

But I'm still bicycling and recycling 

And I'm still eating Gummy Bear vitamins

All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen 

Hyper than Williams, middle son

Since I was a little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin

Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt

Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums

All the best rappers are usually dead

But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet

In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads

Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed

Contagious, speaking while sedated

God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible

I ain't got nothing left in my will

'Cept, ""Throw it all in the casket, it's mine still""

Uh, I need some backpack cast raps

Took a break just to kill the game half-assed

Set some rat traps, went to take a cat nap

Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags

Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic

Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke

Slap her but she like it, tell me, ""Master, feed me pipe""

I'm the scotch on the rocks, you the appletini type

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it

Gees...

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it

Gees, woah...

Ugh, still fucking with these hoes, though 

Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos 

Take a bitch to Soho for some Froyo

Tell her she gon' blow it, Romo

And now I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc 

Young boy, but I'm chilling with some grown folk 

No joke, most dope, you just bowl smoke

How much coke you got to sell to make a boat float?

Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me ""No more"" 

I'm a highly difficult ropes course

Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse

Say ""What's up?"" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche

Who you kidding? Your flow's warshed

I ain't from the street but I'll grill you from the porch 

I been had hoes, I played sports 

Her ass out the bottom of her shorts

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it

Uh... Black James Bond and a white Shaft

Turned my daughter to a queen, turned a dollar to a dream

Flashy as high beams, smoking on good weed

Something from kush seeds, the only strand to smoke for us OGs

I'm rich car service, no car keys 

First class flight, 'bout to land to a new bitch 

She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came with 

MCM bag and nigga, bet some weed in it

200 dollars worth of Backwoods, we all living 

Brought the gangsters back to bucket hat, how real is that? 

I'm getting money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack 

Quarter million in a safe in case I get a case

Faggot-ass judge hating on me cause my money straight 

Dropped 10 racks in all 50 states

Gon' name my next tour Million-Man March 

Make a nun throw it back while I pull her scarf 

She gave me head, my nuts touched her cross, boss

Clean shoes, boy new feet and I'm never in the car with only two seats

I got a whip full of people, all fresh, call 'em 10 Deep

Motherfucker we the future like next week

Young people don't see you as an equal

They just see you as deceitful, trying to send you back to preschool

You only getting one shot, no redo

Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue

I'm Justin Bieber meeting Jadakiss

Here to take what's theirs, treat 'em all like Taylor Swift

Always keep it moving, inertia on these hoes

Boy I'm an asshole, girls call him a douchebag

This some old school shit but no boom bap

This ain't new swag, it's the same old me

The younging get respect from the games OGs

The cameras flashing when we passing, so we stay low key

Go to Mexico, to party where the pesos be

On a turnpike bitch and your tank on E

With my head out the window screaming ""Get like me""

Hoe you should know the way I roll

Take a couple shots and superman these hoes

You ain't nothing with your wack rap

Used to be the class clown, now I get the last laugh

If you in the ride, turn the volume real high

Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building and he would help me with things and I would see him and think ""what a cute guy"" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little we got to know, just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being...finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...

So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other."
135,Good Evening,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-good-evening-lyrics,K.I.D.S,True,"Uh, look

Good Evening

Yeah

When I party in New York, take the late night subway

Goin' out Friday to comin' home Monday

From all directions never find me on the one way flavor

The rhyme just the icin' on the cupcake fuck face

My fans notice these other rappers is bogus

I'm Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

And the boy stay, kickin' incredibly dope shit

Make my mama proud cause my clothes fit

Travel round the globe bitch, on my Lewis Clark shit

Don't matter where I live, cause I can tell you where my heart is

I just stay on my side, fuck where everybody at

Tell the planet peace cause I'm gone I ain't comin' back

Had the whole regular life I can tell you that I'm done with that

Try to build a mill off a couple stacks

On my own business, investin' all I got into these fuckin' raps

Willie Parker money, hand it off then it's runnin' back

Ayo you fuck wit' dat

Uh you gotta fuck wit' dat

You in love wit' dat

Look, uh, Mac Miller

Takin' sips from the fountain of youth

If you ain't heard about the kid then you out of the loop

As I'm sittin' back starin' at this world in my eyes

See out the window in my room that I’m hidden inside

I'm just a kid who stays speakin' his thoughts, talkin' his mind

Life a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride

Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry

There’s logic behind the way stayin' caught in a lie, boy

Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion

Ma'fuckers want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't

They give a little love like everyone does

In reality, they stoned off that competitive drug

And I don't blame 'em, 'cause those who above me, I'm gunnin' for

Try and make my way to the top, startin' from the floor

And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war

'Cause I be on some shit that they ain't never done before

Takin' over piece by piece, startin' from the core

It's only been a year, I can stick around a hundred more

Said I could stick around a hundred more

I ain't goin' nowhere

Young and so much time to go

Jerm, you might as well keep this one rollin'

I got like one more verse I haven't spit three verses in a song in a minute

See if I can remember this one

Aight look

You can find me in the lab workin' overtime

Smell the weed when you going by, global grind

And I ain't just a local guy

When you feelin' stressed out, have an L

Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanel

Live fast when I die better wish me well

Huh, I just hope they servin' beer in hell

Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell

So please, stick around for the Epilogue

For anyone who ever blog, probably heard my name

Hip-Hop's underdog, you wanna win the game

I'm sick of hearin' how music change never be the same

And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane

Call yourself a vet, but haven't won a single game

Mad, every girl got my name imprinted in her brain

Boy I'm a beast, match the style in bars

Find me smokin' weed where the wild things are

Yessir

So I mean, I had to take this time

Real quickly, to just go in

I don't know man I feel like you should never stop goin' in on your shit

That's just me

I mean, Q and Treej out there we excited just makin' history

And Jerm of course"
136,Goosebumpz,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-goosebumpz-lyrics,Watching Movies With the Sound Off,True,"Better act right, 'cause I smack dykes

Give 'em blow and a bit of that bagpipe

Bitch wanna live that rap life, but I already hit that last night

Think you're fuckin' with me, huh? Must be hittin' that crack-pipe

I be makin' my money, thank God I learned how to add right

My cash like that cocaine, give me more, say, give me more

Don't worry 'bout it, ain't no thing, big titty hoes in my videos

Classy bitch, don't kiss and tell

Smack her ass and then wish her well

Life sucks, better give 'em hell

Get money, fuck girls, free Biggavel

A million in my briefcase, 'bout to shop for some real estate

'Bout to party with drugs though, turn it up, bitch, feel the bass

Throwin' money in your face, feelin' good, livin' great

Bad bitches in different states, it's like I think I'm Vincent Chase

With porn stars, sports cars, and my crib got a courtyard

How we get all this money though?

You know how big his tours are?

Greedy bitch, you a needy bitch

Want some money, but need some dick

And my belt monogram

When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, though

When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, though

When I die, bet she fuck my hologram

When I die, bet she fuck my hologram

My hologram

We in my black Benz, windows up

Gettin' head, smokin' blunts

Everybody know what's up, and I turn them girls to sluts

Crib's like a mob boss, my bitch get my car washed

We non-stop, my dick out, her jaw drop

'Cause all we do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck

All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck

All she, all she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck

All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck

Don't I look like a drug dealer? Don't I look like I'm somebody?

Killin' beats with that Murder Inc, don't I look like I'm Irv Gotti?

Ridin' through in my hippy van

You broke bitches don't give a damn

You softer than the Michelin man

Your bitch put her pussy on Instagram

Better go hard when my flow starts

They brand new with they old cars

Your pockets is on low carbs, she do a show, she a pollstar

In the penthouse, with the pants down

With the camera out, no hands now

Them hard drugs, we don't ran out

Can't believe that's somebody grandchild

She's so bad but I like it, wanna hear your pussy, I'll mic it

My credit card bill is righteous but, girl, that ass is so priceless

Spend the night with the right bitch, my dick ill, my pipe sick

Small pussy, tight fit, she loves to sniff that white shit

Fuck free, no charge, I play the pussy like Mozart

Eat that pussy, I won't starve

Love the pussy with my whole heart

Bitch named Layla my Clapton ho

Give me head, put the Benz in captain mode

And my belt monogram

When I die, bet she fuck my hologram though

When I die, bet she fuck my hologram though

When I die, bet she fuck my hologram

We in my black Benz, windows up

Gettin' head, smokin' blunts

Everybody know what's up, and I turn them girls to sluts

137,Got A Clue,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-got-a-clue-lyrics,The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown,True,"Ayoo, you see that girl walk by man... Woooff, she's something else. I gotta say some, you kna what I'm sayin

Glance at her, when she walking by

The type that never stops and talk to guys

She alone and you’re not surprised

Cause she ain’t fit for no other man

So you approach as a gentlemen

Hello ma’am, today you looking pretty damn elegant

I think she get the message like a telegram

I'mma be your cab or your yellow van

Tell me where, I’ll take you where you wanna go

To the top, she perfect and she oughta know

When she walking by the studio

You can see my hart beating through my clothes

When she ain't around time moving slow

I wanna be wherever you gone go

And I wonder if she know my name

She shine like she ain't know what rain is

The game is the same as it was with the lame kids

You wanna hang with her every single day is funny

Your friends say you’re whipped

Every late night you gotta go and dip

To pick her up and I’ve been sick of sluts

And this girl she ain’t gonna give it up

She want me to put in work like school

And I’d be spitting she hit like a fool

But keep my cool, gotta be smooth

Eyes like Elmer’s got me glued

These other dudes is not for you

I think Cupid musta shot you too

Girl, I just wanna talk to you

And I don't think you gotta clue

When you around it's so hard to move

So I had to write a couple bars for you

I seen her at the dry cleaners

Locked eyes

When it’s raining she looking like sunshine

I told her we could have a fun time

Let me just take you out to lunch

I’m a really nice guy

I ain’t gonna' hurt you

I ain’t even bout to flirt too

Cause I’m gonna' be straight up with you

And don’t bring no make-up with you

I just wanna chill

Kick it at the crib

Everytime we kiss it tickles on my lips

I love the way you looking at me

I just wanna see you looking happy

Grab me, pull me, tease me, fool me

Ain't gon let me get it at the movies

Why you sitting over a few seats

Come and move closer to me

I hope that you know that you got me

Here’s my number girl you can call me

And if you guess it, don’t stress

Cause I ain’t having no mess

She the only thing on my mind

I think about her all the time

And it’s hard cause I’m on my grind

But I think I'mma call her mine

Girl, I just wanna talk to you

And I don't think you gotta clue

When you around it's so hard to move

So I had to write a couple bars for you"

And if by chance this is my grand finale

Bury me in Allegheny County

It's the most hated, so faded that I'm bow-legged

Don't bathe, gross gang, smell like old lo-mein

Shit, the flow dangerous, make you wanna do the wave

Throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation

The most strangest, master of the ceremonies

A fifth of Stoli then it’s only Cher and Moby karaoke

My bitch a shooter, call her Annie Oakley

Get you for a pair of Kobe's, just got out on probation

And no famous friends for me, just old faces

I only go places wasted like I'm Joe Namath

Not a king, I'm no David, music, I'm a crackhead

No hobbies and recreation, don't even know my address

Self medicate, self education

Rick Rubin showed me transcendental meditation

Let us have a grand finale

The world will be just fine without me

The clown got a smile on his face

Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang

Are you ready for the fireworks?

It was a silent night 'til the fireworks

Yeah, ok, I fear nothin' on this odyssey of dark roads

God lives in my dog's soul, the devil in his dog bowl

We are the prophets, Jesus was a poor sport

He booted Nostradamus, turned water into wine

But he loved the gin and tonic, had skeletons in his closet

Even God will one day be forgotten

And recently I've been feelin', I've been feelin' like

It'd be really nice to get to sit with Mickey Weiss

Shoot the shit 'bout life, he'd be pissed I'm sniffin' white

Never got to see me grow up, how long it take to live a life?

I'm a bit surprised that I'm even still alive

Mixin' uppers and downers, practically suicide

My old Jewish mind, REMember music, you'll be fine

And I make my own beats now, if you behind

Hallucination's how I use my mind

Who am I?

Let us have a grand finale

The world will be just fine without me

The clown got a smile on his face

Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang

Are you ready for the fireworks?

It was a silent night 'til the fireworks"

Bum-ba-da-bum-bum 

Yeah 

Okay

There's a birthday party happening upstairs 

And it's all for me, who the fuck cares? 

They don't notice if I never go and show my face 

They just looking for a reason they can celebrate 

I hate to waste the vanilla cake that they made for me 

I tell the same stories, they pretend they never heard 'em 

I'll just lay down here inside the studio 

Doing blow and paraphrasing The Crucible 

If you fucking with the God, that's a funeral 

Lose your soul, I’m witcha longer than your student loans 

Who got the ecstasy pills? I need a few to roll 

I'm a real drug addict, homie, you should know

Somebody please tell Jimmy to put the pistol down 

He's serious this time, he's gonna kill me now 

He'll regret it when I hit the ground 

For now, everybody gather round

It's happy birthday! 

It's a birthday party! 

Yeah, happy birthday! 

It's your birthday party! 

Yeah, happy birthday! 

It's your birthday party! 

Happy birthday 

Yeah, happy birthday! 

Yeah, okay

Happy birthday, 

How the fuck you feel? 

Do you ever sit and wonder what is real? 

Do you ever reach to touch her but there's nothing there? 

Do you tell her that you love her but she doesn't care? 

Does she tell you that you hurt her and you're unaware? 

Did you hear about a heaven now you running there? 

Do you think about the fantasy and make-believe? 

Do you cover up your eyes, you can't wait to see? 

Lately, I've been having strange dreams 

Paranoid they hate me, everybody think I'm crazy

Baby, can you take me somewhere where the sky blue? 

You can lead the way, I promise I'll be right behind you 

I do see myself as iconic 

Getting high my downfall it's kinda ironic

Like a condom they on it 

Got 'em in my pocket 

No time to worry, hurry up and light the candles

Everybody 

It's happy birthday! 

It's a birthday party! 

Yeah, happy birthday! 

It's your birthday party! 

Yeah, happy birthday! 

It's your birthday party! 

Happy birthday 

Yeah, happy birthday! 

Woo!

Happy birthday

146,Here We Go,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-here-we-go-lyrics,Faces,True,"Be without fear in the face of your enemies

Be brave and upright that God may love thee

Speak the truth even if it leads to your death

Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong

This is your oath

Yeah, yeah so how's it feel?

Can you feel it?

Polo pajamas, I think I made it

I show my mom my first million, she damn near fainted

The rich and famous, so nice to make your acquaintance

The legends put out the latest, I feel that it sound outdated

I'm the hardest working person in the universe

Temptation victim to the church of Lucifer

Internet rappers ain't shit when no computers work

You spent your whole advance on two chains and a Gucci verse 

I'm the greatest, admit it, I'm the greatest

And I don't hold a grudge against anybody who hated

I'm underrated, don't fit on nobody's playlist

If I ain't in your top 10 then you're a racist

Cocaine ether creates a strange creature

They wasn't hearing me 'till I fucked with a Brainfeeder

I'm still playing it out the same speakers

I did it all without a Drake feature!

So many things that I've created

But this right here might be my favorite

They ask me how I feel, I say ""amazing""

I feel amazing

So many things that I've created

But this right here might be my favorite

Brand new home, I think I made it

Key to the city, I keep to open the gates with

A briefcase with a million under the pavement

That's just on some rainy day shit, yeah

The kids getting murdered that I grew up with

They shooting up doing drugs or they doing nothing

My girl's parents still living out in the hood

I come through in that new Beamer like the shit all good

Damn, I'm just a human let me make mistakes

Shit has changed ain't little Malcolm with a baby face

Even my homies tell me take a break

They know it ain't their place, and this a day I hate to waste

Trying to be a legend by tomorrow

They say I can't, I'm determined to prove em' wrong though

I'm not perfect but they ain't either

I did it all without a Jay feature!

You hear a lot of savage and unnatural things about the people these days"

Everything is strange, that's just a game

Everybody trippin', throwin’ it away

We was getting lifted, now we getting paid

Shame on you 

I paid the cost to see apostrophes

That means it's mine, keep to myself, taking my time

Always into some bullshit, and out of line

Driving with my eyes closed, missing all the signs

Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty

Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah

Man on a mission, figure it out

Putting way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down 

I keep my head above the water 

My eyes is gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller 

I've been gettin' richer but that only made me crazy

Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby

That Mercedes through the PA when I pull up , soundin' like a concert

Or a, or a monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm falling up

Always said I want it all, but it's not enough

Turn the power off and get your water from the spring 

I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy 

I give a hundred and fifty percent

This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I forget

Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm living I'm a little obsessed 

High in Jacuzzis I be hitting the jets

I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex 

Respect to Adonai

Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride

Why you lyin'? Tell the truth and step aside

I don't got the time to let it slide 

I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains

New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings

I've been going through it, you just go around it

Been in this room, like all the time

Look, I'm posing a question

How many been empty and holding aggression?

Close to depression

Open your eyes and just focus a second

Fuck a recession, my brother

My mind is my weapon, I'm letting it go

Loading and pointing at negative energy

Telling me stop, they're telling me, ""No, don't""

Your aura is something you ain't even sure of

Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up

I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought

That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock

Praise me I'd rather you not

Cause it's driving me crazy

The fact that you pay amaze me that's something I love

You come to the club searching for drugs

Drunk, fucking these sluts

God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?

You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting

Why ain't you chasing your dreams, uh?

We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn

The money we earn is something to burn

Why won't they give me a turn out?

Feed the hungry and clothe the naked

You're mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?

When 'em high roller homes in Vegas

Raid 'em with some home invasions

Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day

I waste away in a room spitting these raps

Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back, yeah

It's a gift

Our, our time to be alive

No earthly vehicle

Can contain this drive

It's a gift

Our, our time to be alive

No earthly vehicle

Can contain this drive

Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away

Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate

Dealing with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing the souls

Forgotten, he lost his way

Starring down that barrel, thinking not today

Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious

Fight to the death, 'til there's nobody left

You're holding your breath because you might get infected

I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm getting ballistic

Be specific, to those who in control we all statistics

Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined

My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time

Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior

The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior

The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers

Except I'm cool with Vader

And blowing up rooms that's full of strangers

A news anchor, the youth can relate to, it's nature

If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you

I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors

Really doe, come on homie, we major

I waste away in this room spitting out raps

Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

It's a gift

Our, our time to be alive

No earthly vehicle

Can contain this drive

It's a gift

Our, our time to be alive

No earthly vehicle

Can contain this drive

It's just a different time, man, it's just a different time

There was a time, when we showed love

You know like how we, approach a young lady

You see a beautiful young lady you like

You say ""Damn, man, you're gorgeous""

I'll take off my coat right now and

Lay it down on the puddle and, make sure you don't miss a step

You know what I'm talking bout, young man?

See all these bitches, hoes and... thots? I just don't understand it

For the good times or bad, I’ll be there

Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there

For the good times or bad, I’ll be there

See I was 6 years old with a dream

When my Moms told me I can do anything

Said she’d be there forever

No matter what’s the weather

She’d always have my back even when we weren’t together

And I took her for granted

Thought I had a plan

This a different generation

I don’t think you’d understand

In the quest to be a man

You start to learn you need your family

It wasn’t for them, I’d be way closer to insanity

It ain't about the vanity

Think about what's important

The reason I was 6 years old rocking some Jordans

The reason I had food

My own damn room

A TV and a living room to watch my cartoons

I just hope she know I love her

The world’s best mother

Yeah it ain't fair

So I’ma take care of her and her gray hair

When I get rich, I’ll have her living how she should be

No stress, no worries, you can call me cause it’s

Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there

For the good times or bad, I’ll be there

Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there

For the good times or bad, I’ll be there

Hey, hey, hey

Dear mama, please don’t start to cry

You the reason I’m alive

How these years have gone by

You were there when I was on my first bike ride - riding in the street

That delivery truck almost ran right over me

You were at my games when I was sitting on the bench

When I skipped school, you lied saying I was home sick

Had my back before I had my own

I know I’m always welcome when I’m back at home

I just want to bring you out on stage to get a standing ovation

All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation

If you have your moms, you better treat her right

Call her up, say “wassup” before you sleep tonight

Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did

You may be grown now but remember being a kid when she fed you in your bed, shit

You were her baby, so find out what she doing lately, uh

I wanna tell you momma…

Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there

For the good times or bad, I’ll be there

Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there

For the good times or bad, I’ll be there"

Ha. Yahhhh

Uhhhhh

A million mothafuckin' fans on that ass, biotch!

Feels amazin'!

Ladies and gentlemen, I've always been the same kid, but now I'm famous

And I ain't even have to change shit

Hey yo, they keep on sayin' this dude back, this dude back

But I ain't sound like this dude, bitch I'm Mac

Now these girls all tryna suck my dick, I rap

I may let her if I'm sippin' that yak

Yeah, too fly, submarine in the sky

Can't go out in public I better get a disguise

It's better to be yourself, don't ever just slip a lie

While I'm drivin' with the top down, listenin' to plies

Chicken wings and fries, I'm in love with all the simple things

Little things, hoes just be around always bickering

I got some money, threw some diamonds on a pinky ring

That's why your favorite girl probably on my ding a ling

Chief blunts with peanut, standin' on a tree stump

Rappers need to keep up, my bitch is double D cup

She fucks, but she ain't no slut and she know that

She freeze up, livin' in the moment get a Kodak

Hold that, wait for it to flash, get the picture

I ain't doing much, just out on this adventure

Bus around the country, but I'm travelin' the world

With all these rappers that be hating like I'm battlin' with girls

Hey yo this where the hook be

But I ain't got no hook you pussy

I said this where the hook be

But bitch I ain't got a fucking hook you pussy

Yeah bitch, that could be a hook

You know what I'mma rap

If it's ok with ya'll

And you can tell me if it was nice

Hey yo I kinda want a fur coat, kinda want a grill

She met me at the party, now she kinda want to chill

I ain't on no pills, just a little weed, molly, and lean

Yeah I did a couple drugs, now they callin' me Sheen

This was all a dream just a week ago, now I got a heap of dough

I keep a ho, that always got some weed to roll

All these rappers wack but I don't ever see 'em close

The illest mothafucka in it we don't need to vote

Cause I don't give a fuck what y'all think

And I don't give a fuck what that dude on that blog think

Yeah I seen hay, been in an accord in 3 states

Had to deal with cheapskates, who always want a free play

You hold the weight of the world, I bet your knees break

Put my dick in a bitch hand, keepsake

You can't keep that, fuck off my case

You can keep some residue if I bust on your face

I'm just playin', mistake him as asian

Always been amazin', since days I've been hangin'

In ancient places, now the kid famous

And he ain't even have to change shit, biatch!

A million mothafuckin' fans

Just want to take a second to thank ya'll, you feel me?

Thanks for fuckin' with the kid from day one

You know what I'm saying, Blue Slide Park November 8th

I'll see ya'll then alright

Chyaa

Suck my dick

Ohh shit it worked again! Biotch!

So I just threw this fuckin' mixtape together cuz I love ya'll

How nice am I?"
163,I’m Not Real,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-im-not-real-lyrics,Watching Movies With the Sound Off,True,"Uhh, passport, filling it up with stamps

Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan

She keep on asking for a rack so I ran

Looking back like you can't see who I am

Think my bitch don't know me no more

Cause everytime she's sad, I can't console her no more

If money buy you love, then love's not enough

So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor

If you had the chance

Would you take the time you need to make it right?

The clouds are gray

But would you pay the price to paint 'em white?

Might have a baby on the way

Cause I been going in raw, it feel better, that real pleasure

I'm not real, I think I never was

I get a rush every time she let me get a touch

I need to feel that I need to feel that 

My garden hasn't been growing so can you bring that 

I keep my head up a little fed up 

They always tell me where my mind is on this LP

I don't exist, hieroglyphics

Pyrotechnics, metaphysics

Telekinetics put 50K on my credit card

Look for the answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far

Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon

Decepticons, hit it 'til my head is gone

Point me to the road, and I'mma run it

Bloodhound with my nose to the money

Ain't fucking with these hoes getting ducats

'Til I die, while my foes busy running, fuck it

Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toasted in public

Head in the clouds, when my toes in the struggle

Like who didn't test yet? Test this

There's a few new rules in effect, bitch

Listen up, go

Ugh, yeah

See this a rather spooky action movie, roll it up and pass it to me

Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting bourgie

See a creature, ass beauty, need a feature, rather shoot me

Truly bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi

Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming

Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you in fact assuming

Back to doing cash pursuing, posted up like Patrick Ewing

Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two

These eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship

Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it

Don't forget you infested in nasty crevices

Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly

He and I are not the same

Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain

Money in machines, those will make you change

If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain, but I can't complain

Point me to the road, and I'mma run it

Bloodhound with my nose to the money

Ain't fucking with these hoes getting ducats

'Til I die, while my foes busy running, fuck it

Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toasted in public

Head in the clouds, when my toes in the struggle

Like who didn't test yet? Test this

There's a few new rules in effect, bitch

Just kick it in the cut playing bingo

Look sweet honey bee gonna sting though

I'm here, wanna do my thang

You can roll no matter who you bring

Like your wifey wanna loose that ring

I don't pay her no mind, I just want, I just want, I just want the paper

Bring the games a little more flavor

Say what up, take a flick with a hater

Throwing a deuce like see you later

That's funny, all I really want is a little cash money

Then life is gonna be so sweet, nah it ain't a hotel, nah it ain't a hotel

They wanna get pussy from my—

Yeah I don't say nothing that I don't know

Jumping out the womb wearing Polo

Everybody wanna jump in but I'm old school, lone wolf, took 'em off solo

Yeah, I don't need nobody 

I don't need to be nobody 

I'm just doing my thing

Kick it at the crib, I don't see nobody, no

So over there with that bullshit

We don't need it on this side

I'm pulling up in that new shit

You always whippin' that dick ride

I demand your respect

I won't share my connect 

Lets get this clear, I am here

I don't care who got next, young vet

Feeling like they forget, I let it slide, this time

Like 25 years I've been high and no less 

Shit, I know, I don't guess

Rather glow, I won't stress

Better say that shit with your chest

Okay, okay, well I'ma

Be here for a while, longer than I did expect to

I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued

Now I’m in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel

But I never run out of jet fuel

Well I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to

I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued

Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel

But I never run out of jet fuel

Fate in your hands

While you're waitin' for me

I'm already there

Fallin' in deep

Now is only now

Head back to the ground, dear"

Yeah, who-ho

Hey now

Hey now

Who-ho

Yeah, who's that on the other end of the phone?

Didn't hear nothing when I said my hello

Oh well, to Hell then we go

So high looking at Heaven below

You know me though from coast to coast for smoking dope

Overdose with the holy ghost, but hold the phones

I hold my own, was local grown

Been killing that shit since row the boat

Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest

One more drank, I'mma be an alcoholic

I don't wanna think like better unconscious

Need fresh air that thing so toxic

I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war

Told my mama you ain't need no drama

You ain't gotta cry no more now

It'll be alright

My mind on the run I won't sleep tonight, it's like

When it all goes up in flames who gon' hold me down

And I'm the chosen one

Looking all around what has the world become

The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground

I've been getting paid

About four, five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain

This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'mma drown 

You've never been better than me

From this prison I'm setting them free

Open eyes, I'mma let you see

This world is like our dreams

I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday

I'm running to the edge

And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump

Jump, jump

To see if I can fly

I wonder if I jump 

Do you think that I can fly, fly?

It's the life of an entertainer

I need that check, go on get the waiter

Fuck a troll, this destruction mode

And these explosions don't need detonators

I met my maker in an elevator, he was headed to the top floor

We're quite similar

We just did our work and we were in it for a lot more

We were trying to change the world, but we got bored

When I rip this show, got an encore

Back when we were still in school we didn't listen to the list of rules

Wrote a million words on the chalkboard

I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles

I told my homies the top so lonely

But we ain’t gonna die not now

You gon' make it here, live free tonight till the day appear

Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile

How do we get rich, if she acting crazy I don't need that bitch

Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now

Go on and on, know I had this shit all along

Take a breath, feel this moment hold it just so you can

Look where we at, look where we came from

When will we wake up, lost in translation

You've never been better than me

From this prison I'm setting them free

Open eyes, I'mma let you see

This world is like our dreams

I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday

I'm running to the edge

And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump

Jump, jump, to see if I can fly

I wonder if I jump 

Do you think that I can fly, fly?"

And I know that they never understand

Cause I’m just a kid, but they tell me I’m the man

I be goofy, kind of funny, actin' stupid, but they love me

We don’t do it for the money, just some food up in my tummy

Feelin' cool, livin' great, in the mood, tryna' to sway

Ice cubes in my drink, never doin' what they say

They some losers full of hate, a nuisance gettin' cake

What I’m doin' everyday, probably ruin all your games

I got some brand new clothes fresh right out the package

The moon lookin' like I can reach right up and grab it

So close to the sky I’m high

Was a youngin' who would hope to be fly oh my

God, now I’m everywhere with my squad

When I spit a rhyme they applaud

And I say, thank you, thank you, you’re far too kind

You heard everybody's music, but wait til you hear mine

They either hate or they on your side

Fuck it we ridin', fuck it we ridin'

Playin' games to ease your mind

Damn I’m high, damn I’m high

And I know that they never understand

Cause I’m just a kid, but they tell me I’m the man

If you know me, you are hatin’, listen homie, I’ve been waitin'

For a golden opportunity to know that I’ma make it

Where I’m goin' I could take it, went from flowin' in the basement

To shows in all stages on the road to different places

Got they thumbs in the air, smile on they faces

Fans with grey hair and fans rockin' braces

Fans who be buyin' me drinks to get me wasted

Groupie hoes, thirsty as hell and wanna taste it

See this life even shocks me

I got some people on my nuts call em' jockey

And I ain't even gettin' cocky

But if you hatin' I’ma tell you this, watch me !

Bout to do somethin' amazin' bro

World changin' my brain got a gang of flows

And this for those who always came to shows

And who were still by my side with no bank to blow"

Girls all around me, eyes all red

The true life of a player kid

It's nice to wake up to a naked bitch

Got the finest clothes, diamonds, hoes

Goin' to sleep on a pile of dough

Lacoste, phantoms, yards, mansions

Piff in the cannons, house in the Hamptons

Big parties every night

This is the life of the paradise

My main man twista told'em right

I make'em celebrities over night

Grammys, Oscars, starrin' in movies

Gotta pool house, 4 cars, and jacuzzi's

On my way up, gettin' my cake up

Wake up

It was just my imagination

Runnin' away with me

It was just my imagination

Runnin' away

I got groupies, who got groupies

And I buy a new car every two weeks

My chain got diamonds in it

And my whip got a diamond finish

Got the MTV jam of the week

Sign autographs when I stand in the street

Plus I been all over B.E.T, Columbia records, and D.T.P

Both want me to sign to their label

Plus I got my own channel on cable

Always fresh court-side, best view

Kanye West and beats from The Neptunes

Stackin' cream, magazines

Kids dressed like me on Halloween

They lovin' my mixtapes, money like Bill Gates

I'm on top and it feels great

It was just my imagination

Runnin' away with me

It was just my imagination

Runnin' away"

And roll me some

Hey, then you can pass that, the kid who rock a snapback

Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract

Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray

Now I’m an all-star, blasted out the ballpark

In my Lamborghini speedin', you a golf cart

California dreams, Amsterdam reality

Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me

Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed

Livin' in what seems to be fiction, I’m on a balcony

I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me

Then light another, this for those who hold it down for me

Politicin' joints, we countin’ none of your votes

I’m gettin' everybody high so you can puff on ya roach

Shorty used to all these players, tell her fuck with a coach

I just want you to come over, roll me somethin' to smoke

Hey my mind be cookin' rhymes up, live until my times up

Hate me then they love me, tell them try to make they minds up

Barbers and they line me up, ID was on the beat

It’s best to shout the people out that help you get your cheese

Smokin' weed, we got no problems at all

Me and my homies we was all up on that dumb shit

Hittin' that one lick

Gettin' us dumb rich

Bein' extra sneaky not leavin' thumb prints

There was little Mac killin' packs of fun dip

And my people that been with us since the young kid

Gettin' caught by my pops blowin' haze... smokin' blunts from my younger through my older days

Nothin' goes to waste

Not a day was smashed

There was dough to make

And we was makin' cash

Bangin' rap till the neighbors called the cops

Beatin' dudes up throwin' mollywops

Some people say that I'm all just talk

But I'll tell you everything about the block I walked

I wasn't cookin' pies, I wasn't tokin' guns, but I was lookin' high, stayin' smokin' blunts

Yeah I stole a little bit boy nothin' was cheap

Santa stayed puttin' that coal under my tree

And this is peace to my people and peace to my enemies

But nothin' keeps me alive like my memories...

You make me feel alive, ""These memories keep me alive""

You are my highest light, ""These memories keepin' me high""

You make me feel alive, ""These memories keep me alive""

You are my highest light, ""These memories keepin' me high""

But let's get back to the good ones

We was just chasin' some women

Runnin' the game before we playin' an inning

Now we need that cake to the ceiling

Cook in the kitchen

But these, haters is grillin' fill the place up with villains

Cause we all just chillin' now

Got the illest crowed

Raisin' the roof, uh, breakin' the ceiling down

I'm iller now then when ya'll first heard me

Peace to the people who listened past the first week

And there's a lot of ya'll

So let me take a vow

This to memories

The drinks is on the house

We came a long damn way from sittin' on the couch

Peace to all my honies that was takin' off their blouse

You'll miss me when I'm out

Don't leave me when I'm gone

You hatin' fourty-year-olds I'm peein' on your lawn

I treat you like a jon

The way I treat a beat

When you find something that you care about

Then that's all you got

When you go to sleep

At night you dream of music

When you wake up, is the same thing

It's there on your face, you can't escape it

Sometimes when you're young

The only place to go is inside, that's just it

Music is what I love

Take that away from me and I really got nothing

Ha ha!

This shit right here, feels like a million bucks

Jerm, make sure I'm coming through clear here

Most Dope, what it is

Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to K.I.D.S

Motherfucker, I feel like the hardest working kid in America

Playing with the pros, I remember being amateur

But now I'm rocking shows, see the lights from the camera

Phones

See my people and their hands is up

Yeah the game a girl trying to tease but don't plan to fuck

My older brother told me that I'm finally manning up

Cause I've been a fuck up if you ask me

But I'm still praying that my teachers gonna pass me

Letters from my soul

Scriptures from the Torah

Only give you what you like

I'm a station on Pandora

Rock a sag, my girl tell me pull my shorts up

Rock solid homie

I'm built Ford tough

Sip a little lean

Smoke a little weed

We just trying to keep it cool

So we blast the AC

Some people hate me, tell 'em it's all gravy

Yeah you got your team but I'm fighting with the navy

Battle to the top

We in it to win it, we won't stop

No more going to stores

But don't cop shit

Never go another day with empty pockets

Houston you there?

We balling like the Rockets

And now these eyeballs dropping out their sockets

High honor roll but not thinking about a college

In love with these rhymes, want the cover of Time

Man of the year, got my image stuck in your mind

Hold up one second

Girl this my last L

Imma roll it up with you

Cop some brand new shoes

Put me in a good mood

Imma bring a couple homies, you can call a couple friends

Is there a type of alcohol that you would recommend?

Being young so fun, I don't ever want to age

Haven't came down in the past 5 days

Just trying to tell it like it is

We the shit

You're now dealing with some motherfucking kids

Still got my training wheels in the garage

But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard

Couple trophies on the shelf so what else

Could I want that I don't have yet

Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet

So I can go anywhere anywhere 

Cali for the kush, cause boy I know there's plenty there

'Bout to be in music stores everywhere but not yet

They can't understand my concept

Clean conscience, good Samaritan

Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing 'em

Copping marijuana from the neighborhood Rastas

Chiefing, feasting, king of the new school

I'm speaking in tongues, try translating voodoo

Hold up, let me start again

Undefeated shirt, Levis and a Mr. Rogers cardigan

It's a hell of a feeling, being this fresh

Spit seem to sit upon my lips, call it Blistex

Peddling this medical, the presence of a general

Magazine centerfolds, they all up on my genitals

Got the game in the palm of my hands

Attention, wilding out better talk to your man

He bitching cause I ain't got a lot time for these weirdos

Talking shit all up in my earlobes

I just live life, trying to do it right

Everyone that hear me say ""The boy is super nice""

Put a bitch up on a flight, she gon' be here by tonight

Get some afternoon delight, only eat it if it's ripe

Call me Stanley Steemer, I'll be giving her the pipe

And when I'm out of town she wanna see me so we Skype

She might get obsessed and keep calling

30,000 feet, Tom Petty, free falling

Just laying back, letting gravity take it's course

I wanna tell all of my haters that we made it boy

From basement studios to some official shit

From stressed out all the time to I don't give a shit

Used to dream about it, boy now I'm living it

But they don’t know shit about the everyday grind

Time is money, money is time

They tell me get there at five but I’m runnin' behind

I try and live a little go and have a little fun

You only young once so all the hatin' that be dumb

If life a joke then I'm waitin' for the pun

You all about the beef but me, I’m 'bout the bun, the bread

Cause I was just a little knucklehead

Now I got my shit together spittin' what they fuckin' with

If they ain’t it’s great no intention to the hate

Nothing changed still cutting up, Henny’s still my drink

I’m still the same old dude now makin' moves

It’s like everything I do front page news

I ain’t playin' in this game to lose

I want it all no secret the change they can keep it

When I get old I'm a be real cool

Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes

Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids

Tell 'em to believe, they be makin' it big

And I know

That life is nothing easy 

One day, I'm a change the world

And they’ll finally believe me

My grandpa told me one day I’ll be everything and more

It’s better never to question every lesson that’s in store

See it’s a blessin' that I’m gettin' through the door

The money gonna fall, when it rain, it pour

Dear music, you’re everything I have now

When there’s an army commin' for me I won’t back down

Cause I never was a kid in the background

Just a class clown but who’s laughing now

My moms cried when she saw me in a cap and gown

It feels great to see my family proud, but

I make mistakes too

My people always tell me Mac

Please don’t ever let the fame change you

They say I’m so different, but it ain’t true

Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew

I’m just doing what it takes for me to make do

And everyone around me gettin' paid too

When I get old I'm a be real cool

Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes

Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids

Tell 'em to believe, they be makin' it big

And I know

That life is nothing easy 

One day, I'm a change the world

And they’ll finally believe me"

Oh no, Cam Rellim, haha

Cam Rellim at your service, with these verses

Ay yo I'm park bench chillin', burger patty grillin'

Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin

Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell him come and bring a meal in

My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim

Way above the building, bungee jumpin' down

They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign

Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap

Give a fuck bout what you sayin' after platinum plated plaques

Take it back cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole

Mad that I can rap so well, and everything all factual

Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball

Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call it Adderall

Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work

Black shirt, *Rellim Cam*, that's my name said backwards

Ask first, hell nah, treat em' like a bellhop

Let em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy

I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground

Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground

Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground

Shorty come and kick it at the swings

I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground

Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground

Cops comin', muthafucker stay down

Girl I'll be waitin' at the swings

Ay yo I'm Blue Park slidin', go-cart drivin'

Got this rap shit down to a science

My Louis belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment

You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance

Is just a muthafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big

No that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope

Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat

Students run the class, y'all should keep notes

Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito

Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert De Niro

I be low, key though, young nino with my jeans low

Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go *moaning*

You can hear the way she's moaning

Started back at midnight, had it 'til the morning

Wake up with some morning wood

Hit it before work, yeah I'm sure she would

All my female fans like, ""I'm sure it's good""

I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground

Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground

Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground

Shorty come and kick it at the swings

I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground

Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground

Where'd you go? What'd you do?

How the hell you make me fall in love with you?

You lay with me, now you're gone and

All I've got is this damn song

So I can feel but I can't touch

You said my love was a bit too much

Broke my heart, can't find no crush

So why don't you come on back home?

Hey, I'm a fuckin workaholic with a passion in my heart

Treatin' rappin' as a art, which you have to be apart of

I just copped a new car to hear it's all up

Try to do the right thing and please karma

All I want to know is where the fuck did you have to go?

I've been waiting on you baby

Why don't you leave and come on home?

I can't be mad, I'm living my dream

Going all around the globe

Though you said you think you love me

You need to let me know

So I've been fucking all these hoes

And I've been blowing all this cash

Cause baby this just the beginning

And I'mma make all of it back

Where'd you go? What'd you do?

How the hell you make me fall in love with you?

It's all good, everybody trying to eat tonight

Trying to go to sleep having good dreams tonight

Go home, might get better

All I know: It don't last forever

So take it while you got it, try to get a little more

They say I'm getting better than I've ever been before

And that's for sure, tell 'em what I do

Rap keep me filled like a spoon getting soup

I've been out here on the road

And now they missing me at home

All these ex-girls that I used to know are hitting up my phone

But I ain't here

I guess you can't call back

Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll, I think I'll take all that

Where'd you go? What'd you do?

How the hell you make me fall in love with you?

You lay with me, now you're gone and

All I've got is this damn song

So I can feel but I can't touch

You said my love was a bit too much

Broke my heart, can't find no crush

So why don't you come on back home?

And im losin’ all my patience, I just need a vacation

Your friends all player hatin’

Cause I’m the one you always stay awake with

And spend the day with, always wanna walk ya home

And you hate the way my day to day is on the road

When she know she comin’ home with me she always bring her thong

Bring her lingerie whatever moods she in

Put a movie in, got the lights dim, we gone make love till nights end

Have you callin' up ya friends like oooh I like him

And I smile when I see that pretty face of yours

Givin’ you flavors that you ain't even taste before

We gone make love till you achin’ sore

And baby don’t worry ima be rich

Name in the neon lights

So how about you give me that kiss

Cause you don’t want to sleep tonight

Your one night love gone get swept off ya feet

Yeah lets get undressed from your breast to ya feet

Now let me come with- with something else, you feel me? 

It's Air Jordan on my flip-flops 

And kill me now if I did it all for hip-hop 

I might die before I detox

This ain't high-school, no little Asian I can cheat off 

We keep chiefing while police watch 

Loss in vibration sirens blowing up the weed spot 

And Heisman hopefuls all growing up to be cops

Chasing after gangsters but they never find the G spot 

I'm recording like I'll die tomorrow 

At the rate I'm getting high, it'll be hard for me to find tomorrow 

But I just pray that I'll survive tomorrow 

As she cries in sorrow , she just needs some time to borrow

She'll be smiling by tomorrow

A deadly combination with that ecstasy sniff 

On the phone probably yellin' at Rich 

Say, double the money , please, double the money 

Triple the problems, double the money

They was all laughin', wasn't that funny? 

I started fucking with drugs and now I'm a junkie

The U-S of A, I fuck with my country 

But Uncle Sam could never teach me how to Dougie 

I'm thinking till my brain pops

Spitting is a cake walk 

I'm just a rapper, guess I'm sticking to my day job

When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to doubt

If you're lookin' for an answer, you're probably gonna find it now

And to the man in the hat standing lookin' at his watch

Motherfucker, well the time is now

Go clap your hands, let me hear you say, ""that's the jam""

See I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans

Can't sit down kids you have to stand

Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance

Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan

Iraq, Iran, and have them sayin' Mac's the man

The maximum, coming through to pass you bums

So if you ain't got no money better ask for some

Hey, we came to get down, have a good time

Bring the champagne out and the good wine

We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips

Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis

Comin' in the back door yellin' fuck a list

Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss

We came to party, didn't come to give a shit

Now sing this part, it goes like this

All my people in the front

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

Everybody in the back

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

If you're feeling that funk

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

If you like it like that

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

All my people in the front

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

H-h-h-h-hold up

Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up

I show up cause fans will go nuts

Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch

I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush

Cause girl, you're baby girl, you're good just don't fuss

I wanna hear y'all clap, just like that

Keep it goin' I'mma bring it all back

H-h-h-h-hold up

Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up

I show up cause fans will go nuts

Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch

I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush

Baby, you're baby girl, you're good just don't fuss

I hear these couples fighting all the time, not us

We have a good time, like to get fucked up

What, what, goin' hard tonight

Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight

Hey, driving round in my car tonight

Making music that ain't hard to like, I got the heart to write

A couple bars I might go do

Something crazy or maybe lazy, love me or hate me

You know it's the same me

And it goes a little something like this

All my people in the front

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

Everybody in the back

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

If you're feeling that funk

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

Everybody in the back

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

If you're feeling that funk

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

If you like it like that

Go and clap your hands

Go and clap your hands

Boy a fool, wonder what's cool

Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about

I heard your mans ran crying to his mommy and his daddy

When the cops drove by his house

So who you tryin' to dial

If you're lookin' for an answer, you're probably gonna find it now

And to the man in the hat standing looking at his watch

Motherfucker, well the time is now"
227,Matches,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-matches-lyrics,Watching Movies With the Sound Off,True,"Soul!

Ever since a nigga had recess

Mothafucka felt like a grownup 

Momma come and bitch about a curfew

I was still playing 'round the corner

7 years old saw my first porno, damn, that fucked me up

At 10, I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what

Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid

I'm living too fast, sinning's a habit

I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid

One bean short of an acid tablet

Security guards spark my cigarettes

The old head go 'head and cop me a brew

Sometimes them Koreans be cool

These shades make me look 22

They say you learn when you get older

I just say that that ain't true

That just means when you was younger

You ain't get turnt up like us, fool

Just got Ls so I'm riding high, still in high school but I do

Everything I will do, when I'm 25, no lie

I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes 

Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose 

Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes 

Tell 'em all what they missing, while I watch it as it unfolds

I'm dodging my death, confident kid

I was tryna grow up with the best 

Watching my step, never no college plan

Found myself nodding off always on test-day

I coulda been a great graduate

Woulda got one of them hoes from ""The Bachelor""

Could've been smart, could've been a doctor

Life full of drama, little soap opera

Falling in love, lucky that I caught ya

Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father

All about energy, make good memories

I'm the fucking Dalai Lama 

Only 18 but I had my own business

Then I got fame like ""what the fuck is this?""

Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches 

Everyone around wanna treat me all different

Oh I'm cool, cause I got money? 

Back in high school none of these hoes was tryna fuck me 

I thought it was a conspiracy

Sometimes my thoughts start scaring me

You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

They, they, they been looking for somebody like me

Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea

Something brand new, wonder what it might be

Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed

If you 18 years and older

18 years and older

If you 18 years and older

18 years and older

I wanna rule the world, take care of my family

And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds

Blaze a gang of trees

Went to see a rated R movie about me

They said you must be

18 years and older

18 years and older

18 years and older

18 years and older

18 years and older"
229,Missed Calls,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-missed-calls-lyrics,Blue Slide Park,True,"Long days, longer nights

You keep startin' fights think you always right

Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight

Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin' but I know you might

Now get along, I get along, I go

You sing along, to every song that you know

You play your part, I'm playin' mine

You breakin hearts, ain't breakin' mine

Since growing old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm 8 or 9

Trying to move on, talking to my old friends

See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them

Causing so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that

Ripping people's hearts out, are you too cute for that, cute for that

I been on the same shit

We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language

I guess people always going through changes

Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails

All going into detail

About how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave so

Go, go, I'll be fine on my own, own

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails

All going into details 'bout how you used to love me

I keep changing like the leaves, hell

Go, go, you'll be fine on your own, own

She tell me, ""You an asshole, superficial douche bag

Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back

All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back

All the shit you buy me she said, ""I want you back

I can't be seen again with you and all of your friends

It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when

I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time

Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind

You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to

Think I'm bout to lose you""

I'mma end this now before things just confuse you

Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep

So you can leave a message at the beep

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails

All going into detail

About how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave so

Go, go, I'll be fine on my own, own

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails

All going into details 'bout how you used to love me

Yo what up Jerm?

Beat's crazy

'bout to get my drink on

Go to one of them high school parties you know what I'm sayin? Chyeah

Ayo if you got a cup put it up in the air

And if you smokin' on a blunt better puff it and share

Y'all know you wake up not rememberin' last night

That shorty with the ass like the bottom of a bagpipe

Girl sucked my dick like she was swallowin' a mag light

Gotta get my cash right, livin' in this fast life

I'm fucked up, the room is spinnin', the ceiling is gone

I'm spittin' game on a girl but I'm feelin' her mom

I'm sippin' Crisie, gettin' pissy while killin' in pong

I'm runnin' tables while my peoples are twistin' some bomb

Listen it's on, I'm the man of the night

I shine bright, can you handle the light?

They can't stand that I'm white

With a ego find me like Nemo

Chillin' with the homies and you know we let the trees blow

Y'all ain't makin' one point like a free throw

Haha yeah.. and the beat go

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

And move around, like it was musical chairs

Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

And move around, like it was musical chairs

Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair

Party hard mu'fucker party hard

Have a ball, laugh a little, hardy-har

You hardly saw shit but now I'm all up in your face

With mixtape money boy, my wallet is a waste

With a rubber band, dutch with a dozen grams

Smoking 'til I'm off my head

Now everybody do the runnin' man

We takin' it back, it's easy boy

I'm all three members of the Beastie Boys

So fight, fight for the right to party

Everybody stand up like Steve Harvey

I got surfers like ""Damn he's gnarly""

And mother's givin' me a free bowl of beef barley

Ridin' in the back, back

Back on the carseat

Gettin' out, then pocketin' in the car keys

Young and I'm reckless, with blunts on my breakfast

And I'm rockin' more dunks than Garnett gets

Yes it's Mac.. Mac.. Mac.. Mac..

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

And move around, like it was musical chairs

Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

And move around, like it was musical chairs

Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair

And I'ma get my diploma

You need to notice I'm a scholar

Runnin' through the streets ever since I was a toddler

Playin' cops and robbers

Always was a robber

In my neighborhood all day like Mr. Rogers

Now a little taller, hip hop monster

Eight-legged flow, you can call me Peter Parker

I know you see it boy, I'm weeded and spittin' it real

To match my style, kid you best be equipped with some steel

My swagger mean, dress fresh and so clean

In a flash, getting change like a vending machine

Then I'm out, pocket of piff, hop in the whip

Head to the first dip at the top of the list

Roll in easy got you drinks for the free

On lean and my eyes still chink from the tree

Hoes out the playpen

Eyes behind some Rayban's

It's mayhem livin' in this teenage wasteland

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

And move around

And move around

Get, get, get, get

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

Get down, get up

And move around, like it was musical chairs

Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair"

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are

And baby that's my favorite part

You walk around so clueless to it all

Like nobody gonna break your heart

It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered

I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one

If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry

We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie

Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart

Why would it even try?

Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever

I know you far too smart

Before things come together, they have to fall apart

It's been a while since I've been sober

This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are

And baby that's my favorite part

You walk around so clueless to it all

It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered

I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one

If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry

We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow baby

Cause you and me, and I got enough on my mind

But I can make some time for something so divine

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are

And baby that's my favorite part

You walk around so clueless to it all

Like nobody gonna break your heart

It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered

So I thought I'd start this rhyme with a couple bars and lines of leavin' it all behind

I've had all the dimes

And all are fine but now I need the one to call her mine

You know that girl that everybody wants?

But can't have fat ass, nice eyes, high class

I get the last laugh now cause she under my arm, layin' down, hittin' L's lookin' up at the stars

I tell her listen, I ain't gonna do you wrong, forget what you hearin' on my songs

My always is gone, I'mma be real wit' ya

Recently I've been lookin' at the big picture

Perfectly framed see the way I'm workin' the game

Take my name I'mma share all of my fortune n' fame

Beauty or brains, girl you all the above

True playa' for real but now I'm fallin' love

I'm 'bout to get high with my lady 

You used to the bullshit the dudes put you through it

Cupid, never shot up nuisance

See with me my love is with the music, but baby you can be the next to it

My boys say I'm stupid I need to move along

And when we fight I hope you use this song to get it right

My moms is gettin' jealous how I feel about her

And the fellas say I could deal without her

See baby I ain't playin' around

I don't need cupid dude could have aimed at the ground cause thats real, real

Just had to tell you how I feel

And the party tonights goin' crazy

But I'm just here with my baby

I love the way that she makes me, I'mma just kick wit' her and break trees"

Moon the crowd now, Randy Moss shit

Sharks swimmin' in the water you'll get tossed in

And fuck a first class, I'm in the cockpit

It's obnoxious, it's bumpin' out my car

Bass'll shake your dinin' room table from afar

Down the street, they can hear me pretty clearly

Makin' in a night what your daddy pull in yearly

See a little style, I got mine's patent

Always rock a smile, never a distraction

Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in

Fuck with single ladies, yea I did a little actin'

Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'

Overly dedicated and overly medicated, for certain

Buy her a brand new purse and it's gravy

I ain't talkin' Slim when I say these bitches Shady

Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads

Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans

Never get no sleep, you know all about me

Come and meet my team, bitch meet my team, meet my team

You know all about me, come and meet my team

Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me

Come and meet my team

And if you see me, I'll be with my team

Got my homie Billy probably in Supreme

Jimmy or Will be selling shirts to the fans

While TreeJay, Clock, got you raisin' your hands

Then you got Q that's my right-hand man

Shout out Little Dave sittin' shotty in the van

Everyone I came with travel like a gang bitch

City after city, everybody speak our language

We just flex, get bootleg checks

Got all these people askin' what's next

Success and a dumb fresh life

Taking bets, you trying to lose a little money tonight

I'm on top of the stage but under the lights

We, invadin' your crib and fuckin' your wife

So have a ball, no sports, no Spalding

Poppin' champagne, gon' spray it on her awnin'

Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads

Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans

Never get no sleep, you know all about me

Come and meet my team, bitch meet my team, meet my team

You know all about me, come and meet my team

Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me

Come and meet my team

Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours

What happened to that shit you was talkin before??

Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours

What happened to that shit you was talkin before??

Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours

In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga

Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush

When it still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me

'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'

I ain't know we was on the cusp of the money

Tryna get a few bucks under custody

And my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers

So my kin gully and my skin toughened

Thick lens coverin' my eyes now

They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now

And if this a different way to clear my mind out

I need to find out, I'm doin' fine now

And I don't look as stupid when I talk now

And everybody at the show look astounded

Posted up drowsy

In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me

Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours

Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it

If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us 

Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin

Between you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets

And you workin', givin' arm and a leg

Say he workin' but he just talkin' 'cause he ain't workin'

Like a long distance bitch

Who you know that's out that's harder than this?

Chargin' niggas like a Tomlison win, nigga

Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown

Runnin' wild on the route that was picked

When the clouds branch out

And I'm out with my face in the shallow, I been drownin' again

I could drown you with a shallow soul

Shallow soul, shallow soul

You are drinkin' from a shallow soul

Shallow soul, shallow soul

Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian

Just look at the state he's in, yo, yo

The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist

That ain't suckin' corporate dick

Said it with my balls in grip

Other hand got a cork to hit

All this Ralph be the sportsmanship

Walked in and said I needed all the chips

As well as the one on my shoulder

Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor

Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas

Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so

A generation lost

Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft

Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought

And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost

You ain't Superman when that cape is off

Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high-rise

Tryna see the bright side of life

And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture

It's like hard liquor, and see people are books

So you judge a ma'fucka by the first page

And a bitch by the back cover

The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered

Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage

They said my shit was so insane

It was like Cobain did his last number

Motherfucker

I could drown you with a shallow soul

Shallow soul, shallow soul

You are drinkin' from a shallow soul 

Shallow soul , shallow soul 

Yeah, well

Isn't he dizzy off the up's and down's

He got a lil' Whitney, put it in a blunt for now 

Shit was s'posed to get me high

Why the fuck I wanna die now? 

And I'm strung out on this dusty couch

In a big white ugly house, I tell the bitch, ""Slow down

Stop runnin' your mouth

You holdin' my money, just shut up and count"" 

My right nostril hasn't worked in a week

Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheik

Me, I'm swervin' in the Jeep

Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street

Yellin', ""Play my shit or wake the baby up!”

I get her faded, put it back in her labia

All my life I've been afraid of powder

All my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?

The wrong decision always called my phone 

Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones 

I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone

That can save me from the war unknown

Shout out to Soulo , and rest in peace Alori Joh

The devil on the other side of the glory hole 

Any time, any place, you could bet I'ma eat

'Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road

Look at all these new faces

I see, I see, I see

They comin' on the plane but they're leavin' their suitcases

Been a criminal before scales were digital

Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics 

Hate myself up to strangers 

But the raps are just way too flagrant, so

Here I go 

Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary 

I've never been religious

But I feel like the scripture's got it all there, it's not just gypsies and fairies

This could be my last breath

 I'ma take my time 

'Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in:

Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind

You are standing in a shallow soul

You are speaking with a shallow soul

Shallow soul

I could drown you with a shallow soul

Tell me why I'm so lonely

Shallow soul, shallow soul

You are drinking from a shallow soul

Tell myself I'm free

Shallow soul, shallow soul

You are standing in a shallow soul

Uh, I've been without sleep for 80 hours so I'm beyond simple fatigue"

There you go

A thought is love's currency

And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time

I never seen somebody put together perfectly

What would I have to do to call you mine?

Someone like you is so hard to find

You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind

All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry

Listen to me, I'ma set you free

He ain't gonna break your heart again

Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy

When your imagination's on pretend

I never thought that it would feel this way

You never taught me how to heal the pain

I wish you caught me on a different day

When it was easier to be happy

Just a little taste and you know she got you

Can you hide away? Can you hide away?

Sound of silence as they all just watch you

I kinda find it strange how the times have changed

I wish we could go and be

Free once, baby, you and me

We could change the world forever

And never come back again

Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl

That responsibility is unescapable

I promise that I'll be a different man

Please give me the chance to go and live again

I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?

It seems perfection really is so unattainable

Don't even say you 'bout to end it all

Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself

I'm not so sure that there's an end at all

I wish the truth would just reveal itself

Who do you call to make it to the top?

And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?

And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?

After everything I did I think I'm still myself

Just a little taste and you know she got you

Can you hide away? Can you hide away?

Sound of silence as they all just watch you

I kinda find it strange how the times have changed

I wish we could go and be

Free once, baby, you and me

We could change the world forever

And never come back again

Let's leave it all in the rear-view

Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl

You don't have to cry

You don't have to cry"
248,Of The Soul,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-of-the-soul-lyrics,Blue Slide Park,True,"Looks like I wrote this song on paper

First time I did that in like 3 years..

My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this

Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though

Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso

Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed

Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso

I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane

I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain

All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name

All that does is show me that my life will never be the same

Police tryna to figure out how to get me locked up

I tell those cops suck dog nuts

Arrivin' to the party in a chariot

Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit

I'm very sick, yes, very ill

Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel

At the amusement park scared of heights, ferris wheel

Double dare me to kill?

Got some soul like De La do

They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu

Everywhere you go these people hate on you

It's deja-vu, deja-vu

One time for the grind

A little soul like De La do

They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu

Everywhere you go these people hate on you

Deja-vu, deja-vu

Wind chimes, sick rhymes

Been high on this incline

Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9""

Have some caviar, sip wine

Sacrificin' sanity, sacrificin' normal

Purpose is for people in the plural

Form never formal, an art form, not a mural

Work 4 bars that are tighter than your corn rows

See a girl that's lookin' horny in the 4th row

Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-

Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put em into sonnets

Let me put you on this nastier than Nas is

Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way

Spread, Like yolk from a broken egg

Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

Got some soul like De La do

They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu

Everywhere you go these people hate on you

It's deja-vu, deja-vu

A little soul like De La do

They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu

Everywhere you go these people hate on you

Deja-vu, deja-vu

Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly

Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy

No methamphetamines, hot, 110 degrees

Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED

When I was 17 I thought I had it figured out

Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route

It's crucial, 3 new schools, life with a spoonful

Of sugar, yea I need my medicine

Fuckin Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president

Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met

Some expect me to be the greatest ever

Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever

Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations

I'mma be the best, have some patience

Thought that it was great, then poof!

It was nothing but some deja vu, yeah"

In bed with good and bad biz for the quali-

Fication to have gems played on the FM

Sleeping on us is not possible, the metham-

Phetamine flow keep them narcolepts all on go

Green light and no smoking up that green hype

Keep all your thoughts on haze, the backbones for the sound

Well I don't sound back in the days

The Soul's never outdated

Or overexposed or classified as underrated

Though loved by the popular, worthy of the corn

And when the word drops the whole block will warn ya

Told Mac Mill, you 'bout to mack millions

Millions of tweeters follow ya

A million skeezers wanna swallow you whole

Just watch the game and make sure it doesn't swallow your soul

I love snowboarding, getting my dick washed, writing graffiti

Out in Whistler with a goose on a beanie

I'm mack iller, me and Mac Miller, we mack for realla

Don't make me go back and jab your gorilla

Smoke mad kush, always in fresh pairs

Favorite kickin' dunks and fresh airs

Coolin' under the trees with trees

You know the kid 4-5-6, dice rollers

Put your bitch on her knees

Im stuck making paper, yo fuck what you want homie

The streets is hard luck we rolling with sharks only

Wu-Tang, the gang, the clique

Fucking with my favorite white boy will have your head hit a brick

Ayyo, its Pittsburgh Shaolin, we keeping it realer

Just do the knowledge I'm a Pittsburgh Steeler

The hydrogen and oxygen crew

Body count never read, hear what I said

And let it do what it do

Me, Pos and Rae and monopoly

Hit the lottery buying clothes losing closet space

Wu-Tang, De La, Most Dope

So cold, know I'm about blow, my flow's cold

Deliver the rapper sounds and bringing back to the golden age

So amazed how I go in focused, I can flow for days

Overcame a load of pain, smoking on that novocaine

Love and hate tend to fluctuate like its Oprah's weight

Motivated off of loads of hatred, yeah they mad at me

Game, set, match motherfucker, Mac Agassi

You ain’t in my tax bracket, homie, do work

Rapping as bad as Zack Galifianakis needs two ferns

All I need is some marley lean and the tallest trees

Let my dick show like I'm rocking Tally's jeans

That's something for the homies who won't follow me

Plus I'm on that Wu Tang rocking these Wallabees

I bomb atomically but you already heard that

Wanna be like Killa in a mink coat and fur hat

Pure rap with a new way to be real

Word to Cypress Hill, new rappers don’t need deals

Fuck a gun bullet spray, my speech kill

Plus my money tall, just to reach it you need stilts

I was a youngin' coming through on a three-wheel

Now I'm a motherfucking drug, here's a free pill

Go ahead try it out, have you crying loud

X-factor, I'm Simon Cowell, you Private Pal

So kill yourself boy you Vincent D'Onofrio

Full metal jacket bitch lock and load"

People want to know how we could be that weird

How many hoes want to clean Mac's beard?

I kill flows, think I need that tear on a tattoo

My bitch suck, she a vacuum

Fuck her in the ass everytime I'm in a bad mood

Ain't got a choice, know she do it cause she have to

I hit it raw while I'm listening to Papoose

No respect, cause you wear a V-neck

I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat

I wish Narnia was on a GPS

I wish Rihanna was DTF

Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone

Album filled with all sad songs

Your ass flatter than the back of my head

I bought you dinner now it's time to pay me back with some head

Or I'ma have my little sister beat the back of your head

I'm a grade-A douchebag, I'm a dickhead

Asshole area where my gooch sag

Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough

So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up

Popped a hundred mollies, fifth of sherm, think I was sparking up

A bottle of Zima, the Bimmer, I started parking up

Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back

And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs

And bitch came with a gauge, and she wanted my fade

But I'm a bitch-ass nigga so I say

Looking for the bitches that love to suck peewee, Herman, I'm a vermin

And you could tell I golf with my hat, man, fuck Thurnis

I'm at IHOP's and eating with Tyler

Drink cocoa then double-team Mariah

But please, don't tell Nick

We were all watching movies at a Motel 6

Like ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha

I hope Kendrick fuck Gaga

If Madonna on the Kabbalah

Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas

I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich

Pulling out the llama like, ""Show me your tits""

Young kid who bang drums, money don't you worry I'mma make some

Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one

Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come

A million people in the world, I don't hate one

Even them dummies robbin' people with some fake guns

Make mistakes young boy, that's just what I heard

And you don't ever figure out what you don't want at first

I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts

100 words coming up with what'll have your bubble burst

We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first

Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first

I used to try everything with her, and nothin' worked

Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first

These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid

Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is

It said I can't let me spit a couple sentences

Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this

You just entered into Blue Slide Park

The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart

Up until the sun come up, yeah my crew grind hard

See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark

Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars

Who knew this music would get me a couple cars

That just sit in park cause I'm out somewhere travelin'

Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'

Mac has been known to always spaz again

Every single track with him, ""Oh he's just so talented""

Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses

King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with

I observe, asking what did he design

I see an artificial future for a digital mind

Muhammad Ali, yeah I'm him in his prime

Just that normal kid in class you was sittin' behind

Didn't really pay attention to him spittin' his rhymes

But now you see his car, tryin' gettin' inside

No, hell no

I wanna go back home

Late night can't remember what the day's like

Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights

Cause it seems that I'm always on the move

When they gonna let me back home

I wanna go back home

I wanna go back home"

I ain't nothing like you

So what is going on?

There must be something wrong

You'll love me when I'm gone

I'mma keep on doing me

Cause you don't even matter

No, you just an actor

And I ain't just a rapper

I'm one of a kind 

Here's a prototype that I know you like right

Headed to the light on over night flight

Never in your life you going see another me

I tend to catch the eye like a pair of double d's

I'm here, not the same, I'm a pioneer

Stabbed the game in the heart with a giant spear

Grind to see success, God damn it's clear

The time shine like a chandelier

I'm going through this cake

Spitting about what you relate

Never could you duplicate

Any of the music made

Getting super paid

Looking at your future star

They recognize me when I pass them in a moving car

Always worried about finding out who you are

You know somebody, you got look into his heart

Yo mind so blind

I'm ahead of my time

Cause I'm one of a kind

I ain't nothing like you

So what is going on?

There must be something wrong

You'll love me when I'm gone

I'mma keep on doing me

No, you just an actor

And I ain't just a rapper

I'm one of a kind 

And my pops said

Young man you ain't ready for the world ahead

Way too much marijuana

Always having girls in the bed

You going realize that life ain't a party

Fuck around, you going end up starving

Fuck it, I stay fly, live free, die hard

No Bruce Willis, this the whole nine yard

Thought that I can rhyme bars

Go and buy cars, you gotta grind hard once the sun rise start

In my heart great things in my future

Cause broke rappers, shit, that's just a rumor

I see these diamond chains, mansion in the videos

They must got silly dough

Do they really though?

Or is it all just a scam for your eyes?

Or are you in disguise

God damn I can't decide

All the words here come from a mind guy

Got nothing to hide boy

I'm one of a kind

Walking through this world, I just take a look around

Ain't nobody here like me

Don't nobody got my style

People say I'm different, I assure you that's okay

Cause I'm way past tomorrow

And you stuck in today!

I ain't nothing like you

So what is going on?

There must be something wrong

You'll love me when I'm gone

I'mma keep on doing me

Cause you don't even matter

No, you just an actor

I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit

I know you gotta feel this

I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit

I know you gotta feel this

I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit

I pull my hoodie down and take a look around

Sounds that shook a town, man it feel good to smile

So I shouldn't frown when the night is lookin' down

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the smoothest crook around

Taking some dollars and making away from Impalas

Shakin' the Jakes cause they chasin' the face of a robber

Actin' goofy, absolutely

Cause my passion suits me, so blast the tunes please

I see the world with four eyes, hip-hop tour guide

Hear the war cries, rap or die

Wanna get signed, drive a four door ride

Be more fly

Til then I'll just soar by

With a wave

I'm a bat in the cave

Sit back in the shade when I'm passing the haze

Misbehave, I'm a trouble-making teenager

Be grateful he's able to please haters

Seat taker, three-term Mayor

Getting re-elected just three terms later

I've seen greater days so let the haters play their game

Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey

The ace of spades can make it's way to save the day

But from the start a club of heart was diamond

Now I'm in Zion flying through the skyline

The game on my back I got five spines

Black cat with nine lives

Time flies by

So I got one life to loose it

But how will I use it

Uh, I put it all in the music

Cause ya'll pussy

Fold away before they hand your cards

Broke-ass rapper now you Dancing With The Stars

I'm handling these bars like a simple situation

Basing on them cats who don't fit in the equation

Patience is a virtue but fuck it I want it now

Get my record deal ready, get Diddy up on the dial

Hello wassup Puffy, I'm on my grind and hungry

Throw me to the people they gon' love me, trust me

Cause these older cats are getting a little rusty

It's time for a change like Barack said

And I don't care

Hip-Hop is not dead

Spit hot lead, but none of these haters get shot dead

They don't bother me, I'll leave them playin' for my wife

Kick back have a laugh while you complain about your life

""Grrr"" you hate Mac and you say you gonna fight

It's all good bro, you entertainment for tonight

Like I'mma be mad you hatin' cause I'm white

Do a lot a cryin', lettin' pain out on the mic

Cause overall I'm iller than most of ya'll

Yall pussy, never ever gone for it all

You scared of a little risky coachin' call

What happened, I thought you were the know-it-all

I stay smokin' well haze got a potent smell

It take me back to kickin' raps back in Show-And-Tell

I wanted to show people, all of my bro's peoples

Have a dude come up like ""Yo, I know people""

The need for Dead Presidents, this dough evil

So lethal, police'll always try to beat you

Seat you down try and have you run your mouth

Bring your mother out, look what your son is now

See my mom she know her son is well

The youngest child, she been through it for a while

Now I put 911 on the dial with a smile

Cause I'm wild, foul child style

Too focused on my grind to ever catch an ""f""

My heart in it down 8 with five seconds left

I want the best, won't settle for nothin' less

And I always stay dressed in somethin' fresh

So keep your head on straight and show respect to the game

And that's what this beat messaged my brain"

We outside, outside

I wake up, throw on some clothes and out the door, I won't be back ma

Shining sun, horizon setting up a lovely backdrop

My life's a topic of a lullaby

Ah, a breath of fresh air is something right

I don't wanna be inside today

Just keep it rolling like we riding skates

I got a half E of haze, I'm thinking we gon' get high today

And let the sunshine all in my face

Oh yeah, this life is good, don't let it all go to waste

Just walk outside the door to get your mom off your case

Yeah, free-living, I swear I be on some hippie shit

But getting way fresher than the hippies is

I got the the gift of gab, something that you wish you had

Don't need to get a strap, no, I'd rather kick a rap

Enjoy the place that you living at, stay around

We just some kids and this world is our playground

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?

And everyday feeling like it's Christmas

The kinda weather had the people living so privileged

I know the Lord take, today he was tryna giveth

Hey, hey, ey, rich or poor, a sunny day a sunny day

We start the madness as soon as we hit the month of May

Rain rain, go away

Waiting for my homie Mr. Sun to come our way

Little kids running through the streets playing'

Poppy on the porch, he ain't got time to waste it

He's just a old man in the sea, Ernest Hemingway

Elevate, look up in the sky, stare at Heaven's face

Second grade, holding down the corner slanging lemonade

Everyday hustling, you riding down penny lane

You ain't gonna get a day like this

So put to rest your troubles with that goodnight kiss

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?

Cause it's nice out and we could get high

Yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right

We could post outside for the night

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?

No time to care, more I can share

By now, this life is all I know

So this is all I know, this is all I know

Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight

Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit

So make a toast to the good life

Hey, hey, 10,000 dollar hands, billion dollar plan

Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van

This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code

Happy as hell, MDMA, yo!

Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss

We just tryna work so we can blow up like a molotov

And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop

Thinkin' bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust

Got me thankful just for life by itself

And there's way more people here I should be tryna to help

Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do, probably yes

It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest

You got ya thumb held high, we can be friends

Other people pretend, we hang out on the weekends

These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them

Say get some rest, when I die, I'mma sleep in

Pennsylvania nights, 9:30 flights

Thinking to myself, where does all this go?

No time to care, more I can share

By now, this life is all I know

So this is all I know, this is all I know

Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight

Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit

So make a toast to the good life"

This the main event so watch the people pull they seats up

Bottle of some gin, let's just hit a couple freaks up

I'mma take one home and have her singing like the Glee Club

Never on no cheap stuff

Here we got expensive taste

Green lights, never press the breaks

You can look at us roll

All the kush that we blow

You know I’m at the shows looking good for these hoes

Got they man on patrol

Shorty wanna live it up

Playing hard to get but she wanna give it up

Yeah you smoking good but I'm probably smoking better

151, taking shots with no Baretta

Know me homie, I'm the king

You could watch me do my thing

With a drink getting drunk, having one night flings

This is Pittsburgh, home of the six rings

We getting money now, all we hear is ""Chi-ching""

And we do anything to get this paper

So they follow everywhere we go

So for the bullshit, we ain't got later

Cause we out here on this road

And we do anything to get this paper

So they follow everywhere we go

So for the bullshit, we ain't got later

Cause we out here on this road

Cool ass, fly around, chilling, young fool

Gin cup sipping, that's me, that's what I do

I got the gang in my bloodstream, strong how I'm living

And now I'm G'D up so they just throw away the kitten

I swear you hella bad the homie Mac tell me about you

But we cool if you stuck up we can go without you

We on the money we schoolin' you know you wanna be on the block

I swear the homie got a gift so he don't need the block

Zig Zag papers, king size

Smoking chilling in angry cars, mean rides

Pops was a hustler and Moms ran track

So tell me what you get in me when you mix that

I just sit back light mines

And middle finger you suckers with my nice rhymes

So whether home or on the road

We getting dough it follows us everywhere we go

And we do anything to get this paper

So they follow everywhere we go

So for the bullshit, we ain't got later

Cause we out here on this road

And we do anything to get this paper

So they follow everywhere we go

So for the bullshit, we ain't got later

I think- I think I see where you're goin' with this one E

Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that

Still kick raps that cause impact, so where’s my kids at?

These muthafuckas hatin', soundin' funnier than Sinbad

I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse

This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?

We the assholes that she warned you about

We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud

Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that it's wild

6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down

Twin sisters gettin' wasted so they both are down

It's goin' down, I thought I told you man

If you tryna to party let me see you raise your hand

There's a party on 5th Ave., hit me if you tryna go

I can be there in like 20

I'mma honk it and come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road

Make you sure you gotta clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes

Or just hitch a ride there, you choose

There's a party on 5th Ave. tonight

And that's what I'm tryin' to do

Hey, what's the difference 'tween me and you?

When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than Beetlejuice

Don't count on the sheep to snooze, I'm fucked up off weed and booze

I party then sleep 'til noon, what every day people do

So haters see me improve, just give me a week or two

See when you read the news, my bitches all sleepin' nude

My rhyme talent is why my album is fly

Your favorite record, you gon' put it aside

This that old school shit soundin' good in the ride

And fuck ten, I'm only countin' to nine

Said this that old school shit soundin' good in the ride

So let's head out to the party, I'll drive

There's a party on 5th Ave., hit me if you tryna go

I can be there in like 20

I'mma honk it and come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road

Make you sure you gotta clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes

Or just hitch a ride there, you choose

There's a party on 5th Ave. tonight

And that's what I'm tryin' to do

What's goin' on? There's a party

Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud

Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right

We came to get down, we gonna do that now

My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on

My light up shoes on

They love the way my kicks flash

This ain't a time to just sit back

'Cause there's a party on 5th ave

There's a party on 5th Ave., hit me if you tryna go

I can be there in like 20

I'mma honk it and come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road

271,Pen Game,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-pen-game-lyrics,The High Life,True,"I love money, I love money

You take a buck from me, you Doug Funnie

I said I love money, I love money

You take a buck from me, better duck dummy

With my man Skyzoo, it's the class clown of his high school

Drown you in typhoons, hittin' you with rhymes too

Haters keeps their eyes glued, pound if you my dude

We stay high like Einstein's IQ

And y'all muther fuckas know where I'm comin from

Chewin' cats up, like a little piece of bubble gum

Tryin double sum's, hustle, wanna let my money run

I ain't even battling dude, I'm having fun with it

Jokes make him feel wrong in his own skin

Sippin gin from a bin that's makin' my dome spin

And you the type that'd try to take from your own kin

Feel it close on your toes, hangin' by clothes pins

I'm spittin blades, God damn it, my tooth hurts

A mouth filled with a bunch of cancerous tumors

Yup, music's my baby, I ain't gonna lose her

So I stay with a radio, like Cuba Gooding Junior

 

Who you think could body me lyrically?

In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater

My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn

The pen game insane

I'm one drink away from everything you meant to say

Like I think he on the rise of what the kings made

And in the blink of an eye I'm on the king's page

But no album, this is all for the mixtapes

In a different lane, no signs of road rage, cause ain't nobody over here to rage quit, so no gains

No sleep, no retreat, no surrender, no apologies from me

I'm the pen of the penners

I mean what I speak, so if I given you a sentence

Then it be's what it be's, nothing hit on the agenda

You leave it up to me, and you can divy up the team

Put your pride in the air and I'm dismembering your members

The heart of the city, the star point guard, that can play up to the fall

So the parts is all gone, no room on the bench

And I got a no trade clause, so I'm here, long haul, no switchin'

Look, I rip mics to pieces, cook 'em or eat 'em raw

I was bustin' freestyles before I could read at all

MCs just call me the monster in their mind that haunt them all the time

And they thought if they could rhyme they could make the situation a lil different then the present

See, I fucked this track, worried that I got her pregnant

I'm haulin ass, y'all is whack, taking out the garbage, trash

Duckin' from these sharks and crabs, giving MCs heart attacks

Its yo' boy Mac, damn I'm great, and you gets, no love like a man with AIDS

I fill you dancin' gays with some hand grenades, drop bombs, remove your hands and legs

And I pray; dear Lord please give me the strength, not put these little snakes in their taint 'till they faint

Suffocating, now you choke, you a broke MC, now ain't nothing to do but smoke your weed like..."

You playin' politician, you Martin Sheen on ""The West Wing""

Guessing, the best thing for me to do is spit it

This shit is never a gimmick you listen more than a minute

I’ve been spittin' flows since a kid was 6 years old

And if you listen close I’ll do this like some mismatched clothes

It’s whatever, put it together

You never could be this clever

I’m rocking the mic forever, you gonna stop me? never

I’m cocky, because I love it you Rocky without the punches

Hockey without the ice, and boxes without the lunches

Flowin' like me knowin' and I got you mad, bitch

Saw your boys are nothin' but just a-verage

I ain’t telling nobody how they should live their life

I got my own shit to deal with so that just isn’t right

I’m just tryna to leave the crib, go out and live tonight

Shit, fuck that, I'm locked in the lab, workin’

Droppin’ a track, beats get bodied and bagged, certain

See the world through first, second, and third person

Omniscient, listenin' so efficient

Trapped in my own goal line, ready to go the distance

Consider it a privilege that you get to witness

History in the makin', you fucking bitches

Haha, just playin' with y’all

Still in line waitin' for my name to get called

275,Perfect Circle / God Speed,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-perfect-circle-god-speed-lyrics,GO:OD AM,True,"Woo-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

 I came for whoever is in charge

I suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard

They need some coffee, everybody’s sleeping on me

Going around door to door, setting off alarms

All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn

Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah

Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made

I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase

Me and my bizarre ways 

I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant

You can see it from a scar face

Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank

Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in an arcade

 Not a second to lose

I’m the motherfuckin' Bible, that’s forever the truth

And this is not another case of the celebrity blues

The devil with me and he tell me to shoot

Murder, murder, murder, murder, what would you do?

Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do

Can you draw a perfect circle?

Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?

I wash these pills down with liquor and fall

Leave it to me, I do enough for us all 

Got what you need if you like breaking the law

My mother raised me a God 

Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday

Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway

Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase

Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case

Used to wanna know how a freak taste

Now I’m in it in an instant like replay

Broad’s a baton, pass it off like relay

Why I’m so mad on my B-Day?

She say “I thought you got sober”

And I say “I wish you’d stop being a bitch

And get to minding your business”

Told me “Money has changed you”

I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?

How’d I get so egotistical? I’m a Buffalo Soldier

Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer

I’m only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it’ll forever be

Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies

Murder, murder, murder, murder, what would you do?

Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do

Can you draw a perfect circle?

Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?

I wash these pills down with liquor and fall

Leave it to me, I do enough for us all

Got what you need if you like breaking the law

My mother raised me a God 

A goddess told me “good morning” when I woke up

You know I had a good morning when I woke up

Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up

Would you remember me if I never woke up?

Bye bye 

I've been a sinner, I’m just tryna stay

Warm through the winter, and I’ll be on my way

I’m just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers

I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind

Woo-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

Woo-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system

412-9…. is not available

“Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays

Uhm, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night / weekend

/ I hope I talk to you soon, alright, godspeed”

Oh yeah

I thought I’d have it figured out by now

Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now

Me and the homies would be sitting on millions

Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'

I thought I’d have it in the bag by now

I thought that we’d be kickin' back by now

I know that life is a bitch

I know that life is a bitch, I thought we’d put her in a cab by now

But I’m stressing, I can’t relax

Swallowin' my pride and I’m hiding what’s making me mad

Everybody saying I need rehab

'Cause I’m speedin' with a blindfold on and won’t be long until they watching me crash

And they don’t wanna see that

They don’t want me to OD and have to talk to my mother

Tell her they could have done more to help me and she’d just be

Crying saying that she’d do anything to have me back

All the nights I’m losing sleep

It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that

But white lines be numbing them dark times

Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up, admit it’s a problem

I need to wake up before one morning I don’t wake up

You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya

I’m too obsessed with goin' down as a great one

But if you wait too long they gon' find someone to replace ya

So I guess this is a letter

To all my brothers, Most Dope, that’s forever

I love you more than words could express

And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain’t already yet

I did my best to be a leader you respect

At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret

So tell my baby I love her

And if she give me the chance I’ll put a seed inside her, make her a mother

Just know that there’s a place

Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight

Every devil don’t got horns, every hero ain’t got capes

Opened up my eyes, shit, I’m finally awake, good morning

Yeah, good morning

Yo Vin, it’s the morning, you gotta go to work

“alright”

Yo, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo

“I’m straight, yo what’s good?” 

You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?

“man, fuck that shit, I’ll skip”

You 'bout to go to work?

“Mmm”

Aight, what time you gotta be at work?

“I don’t know…. soon”

You Democrat or Republican?

“Uhh…I don’t know anymore”

Would you vote for a female president?

“I don’t care what gender or race you are”"

Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

Yeah, tell me you love me, spin me around

Pretty please pick me up in the air and don't put me down

Seen it all unfold, sat back and watched

Knowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop

Bare feet, runnin' late, her car started

Even though the only thing that she drivin' a hard bargain

More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but

She put me back together when I'm out of order

Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, yeah

Fucking rabbit!

I give no fucks when I go nuts

Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead

Woke up from a coma

Poured up with a soda, smoked, went back to bed

Never thought I'd be such a loner

I tell my bitch that I fucking own her

My neighbor's daughter just got a dog

I'ma run it over, I'm a fucking soldier

So cold bro, fuck pneumonia

All my bitches got love for Sosa

I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta

Strung out to the night, I'm chilling

Everybody worried that the lights might kill them

Uh, via sight slipping

Long lines of those white women

I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows

Just went through a half ounce of coke

Blood pouring all out my nose

Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem

I'm fucking high-ly publicized

When the sun go down, I come alive

Cause the guns go off in the summer time

The guns go off in the summer time, blaow

Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long

Spent all my cash on a broken dream

Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean

Getting wasted as the time that I'm spending high and sedated

I'm putting five in his face, because we don't buy into bullshit

As soon as it's flashing lights then it's kush to hide in the bushes

I do this shit out of spite cause there's niggas that overlooked me

Forever, I'm more content with dark and stormier weather

Flip the fucking cross on your rosary, we supposed to be better

But here's a toast to your efforts

And don't approach me with nothing that isn't money or breakfast

I'm close to choking a pussy, pussy

Sweaty Man, you best had bet your bottom dollar on him

With a couple niggas, weighing sess like it's a lot of options

15 on me for soda and swishers

And who's the shit, a bag of chips and a colon decleanser?

I'm over bitches trying to act like I owe 'em a picture

Rather introduce these hoes to Vince who could show you a pistol

Listen, ST was the older initials

Been rap game tighter than boa constrictors

Rolling stone like a boulder raving

I'm so impatient and going dumb as

Disclosing my fucking home location to total strangers

No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink

Cashing out off the garments, the artist, fuck what you think

The sky'll turn black and the carrions could pick

At my flesh when I rest, tell 'em bury me adrift

For anyone who's gone from the coldness of violence

And I know you wanna see me go to college

But I'm sorry I don't think that I'mma make it

Cause this world is mine for the takin'

So when I get famous they gonna know what your name is

And no one understand what the pain is

And how the blood runs numb where my veins is

I'd like to thank you, cause you made me a man

Told me to never let it go so I'm taking a stand

Always in the crowd when I played in the band

Your grandson is everything I say that I am

And maybe I am, a little bit over my head

But I'm feeling so alone tryna cope with your death

Holdin' my breath, wishing I had one more day

Wishing you could be there when I graduate

Uh, and it's sad to say that no one in this room understand me

I know you had to leave, so rest in peace, but please can you watch over Nanny?

Cause she loved you, and I love you

All the prayers I'm saying may bug you

But I'm just checking in on what you up to, so how they treating you up there?

Too stubborn for a cane, way too cool

Sleeping at your house, walking me to school

Thought I was a fool when my grades start slippin'

When I played ball you was always in admission

You loved me more than I've been loved before

And that's a type of thing that everyone ignores

But not me, you got me

Always and forever, poppy

Times goes by, going without you

Hope you know, I've been thinking about you

And I know, I know, I know, I know that they took you from your home

But you're in my heart, so I'm never gonna be alone

Times goes by, going without you

Hope you know, I've been thinking about you

And I know, I know, I know, I know that they took you from your home

But you're in my heart, so I'm never gonna be alone"

What if I'm fuckin' with my butterfly lady

In the backseat of the 'Cedes, or the Saleen

Something that I cop, made in the eighties

I've been lost inside this puzzle

Rearrangin', keep on sayin'

I'm a god damn fool

Tell me quit playin'

I'm like, ""no can do""

Been through this bullshit

Actin' foolish as a dude that's hit with Cupid doings

Music is the key to everything I keep pursuin'

Bitches used to do the friend thing

Now they ask me what I'm doin'

Trying to give me head before the show

Go out, I'm interviewin' with a student newspaper

Maybe with the radio

Curb Your Enthusiasm

Huh, the Larry David Show

It's something that we probably watchin' while we be gettin' high

Step aside if anybody think they lookin' fresh as I am

With my Daily Bread hoodie and a floral hat

This shit these rappers talkin 'bout

I'm getting bored of that

This, or that

And a wiffle ball bat

Make a million dollars

Then I give it all back

These rappers talking shit

When they shit is all wack

Yeah I said it on wax

Pulling stars from the sky

Live large, get high

Women lie, men lie

But we always fly

At the end of the movie

Dubs always cry

Pulling stars from the sky

Live large, get high

It's all live, baby

Golded up like Tut

It make guys hate me

But I ain't giving a fuck

I tell them, ""drive safely""

How dare a man lift his hand at me

Like I'm goin' flinch, I'm not no bitch

With the concreature concrete monuments

Your man prolly pack his bag if you tryin' to trip

Nick Bruno, Boldy James kinda shit

It's like the Godfather, y'all gotta honor this

Tryin' to split the money up like communists

You should shake the person hand that put you on to this

Hold up, that's the swag you would kill for 

What the fuck you tryin' to chill for 

Are you alive or a still born

Cause you really ain't livin' till you get yours

Sky's the limit, we could build doors

Open 'em up, nothing gon' be closed, I'm sure

This, or that

And a wiffle ball bat

Make a million dollars

Then I give it all back

When they shit be all wack

Knock you off your feet and then I flee before the jakes come

Sick of hearin' cases from these niggas who ain't face none

But I'ma be the nigga that they feelin' when the day come

Thirsty for the pay, young niggas led astray

Stray bullet hit my brother in his mothafuckin' face

What's fate when a person don't deserve what he get?

Shootin' reckless at the father, almost murdered the kid

Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?

Ain't embarrassed where I'm livin', we get merit for kills

From a family of niggas that was veteran skilled

Voted heartless cause my momma made me part of the guild

Deals made, sellin' thrills paid the bills at the crib

Drag him down by the river, he'll be missin' for years

And them funerals was usual, ain't sheddin' no tears

Knew the fallen had it better off than most of us did

Cause shit, Heaven knows, Heaven's gates prolly closed

And these hoes in a race for the gold

We was raised on that fork in the road

No food on our plate, just the meals that we stole

Yeah, oh-woah-oh

Oh-woah-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, um

I spit that prayer hand emoji, that shit that injured Kobe

The holiest of holy, Nick Nolte in some Oakley's

That's a flex though, cover up the issues that I kept close

Sober I can't deal, I'm in the corner with my head low

Runnin' from my shadow, never ending chase

Ease the pain and the battle that's within me

Sniff the same shit that got Whitney, the high heel depression

My temple feel the metal comin' out the Smith & Wesson, bang

Say a prayer, leave my brains on the tile floor

My bitch hate me, always tell me I should smile more

Off them drugs that hit you in your spinal cord

This the shit I need to keep the climate warm

Wish I could get high, space migration

Pretend I can just fly to great vibrations

The magazines need a quote

Now I'm gone, sorry I don't even know, yo

Woah-oh-oh, yeah

And this pain, and this pain

And this pain, and this pain

Mixed up with this rain, this rain

This rain, this rain, woah-woah-woah-oh-oh

Yeah, haha

Uh, think I can see a fucking halo , about to meet my maker

Brought a double cup of Drano , some soda for the flavor

Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies

Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches

He got special needs 

Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy

My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe 

They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me

My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly

And my denim tailored , me and Action rapping

Al be fucking with the fader , sipping mind eraser

Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it

Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public

We the Republican government, abundance of substance

Having consumption to fuck a bitch 

You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick!

And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit 

Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick 

Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth 

Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle 

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit 

Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit (I said it must be the drugs

They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead 

So how'd I get this red dot on my head? 

Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first 

After rapping take my people out for octopus 

We all deserve it; dedication to the fam 

Don't hold your hand out for nothing

If you claim to be my man, damn

You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip 

Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip 

Shit, I'm on some shit

Hands are fucking hotter than a leather in the 6 in the summertime 

Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine

And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils

We ate the tuna, it's suede Puma

My look is Jay Buhner, dawggy

‘Cause some of us just age sooner 

I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river 

Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver

Check the bio 

I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild

So how'd I get this red dot on my head? 

Uh, uh, bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce

And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance

I was a minor, chasing after vagina

None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer

Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs 

I came from that basement, now look at this view 

Making this money, blowing it all

Fuck what you did, just show me results

Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly mothafucka

Leather to the foot, horses, I led 'em to the brook

If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book

I see a lion in the mirror when I look

Look, I lose money, but I make it back

I keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that

I get a fade and then I fade to black

Bet on the Razorbacks

I hold the multi-colored flavored gat – blat!

I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs

I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs

I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs

Who the fuck is Mac Miller?

This name says ""Crack dealing trap nigga slash cap peeler

Back with a black stripper

Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers""

In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller

Now my mind's first track figured

A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor

Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna

Oh, you Mac Miller?

The fact's filtered in the snapped picture

My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper

You who I'm finna murder, this brunette bitch

Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture

A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter

I'll show you 'beastie,' boy

You can't match your killer with that wigger

I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller

He got track fillers for a album

If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker

Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm

I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King

You're from a home of funny bones

Not like quite the one I've known

You look like, before you punched in flows

You were strucking blows, bloody nose for your honey rolls

In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole

You're a bully's best day ever with them Nike's on your feet

Coming through Blue Slide Park

I'm gon' rob this chump

On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump

Nigga, give me that shit!

Going through memories

Like they were movies scenes

I know I've been the shit

All these people full of me

I admit I guess I'm full of myself too

There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you, but

This life moves fast, I never knew that

Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops

I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops

For now, I need to run to any

Place the train stops

And everybody wanna talk to me

About some business shit

Never really listening

Couldn't get real interested

My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up

All this hate, sound the same

When my name get brought up

You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up

So I could meet your son and talk you up 

I remember when we were just kids

We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived

In West Virginia, lost somewhere out in

West Virginia

It's a dark science, when your friends start dying

Like, ""How could he go? He was part-lion""

Life goes on, tears all dried in

Couple years are gone by by then

Can you please help me find my friend

I'll give you anything you need

Multiplied by ten

I heard he moved to a place

Where the time don't end

You don't need money

All you got is time to spend

Life is short, don't ever question the lengths

It's cool to cry

Don't ever question your strength

I recommend no limits, intricate

Thought, go 'head just give it a shot

You'll remember shit you've forgot

Cause way back then I didn't know shit

And I don't know shit now

And when the whole world is looking hopeless

I'mma still hold shit down

I remember when we were just kids

We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived

Have your girl always comin' back like Elway

So let me start workin' with this paper like an essay

Hey, athleticism, workin' game when I'm gettin' women

The freshest linen, like I'm spittin' through your television

In a daydream, living while these minutes pass me by

Lean back and hang these Nikes out the ride

Just

Role the windows down, turn the system up

We just trying to ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck

Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke

Hey, let's just hit the road

Rocking khaki colored jeans, and a plain white T

Nike watch, Pow chain, spend a day like me

Hey, everyday like a movie scene

Smokin' weed, eyes glued to the computer screen

I'm Super duper skeed, ridin' in the Civic

Just got some speakers, now I'm tryin' to get it tinted

Every dream vivid, talk it how I live it

Uh, up in the air playing 'quidditch', bitches

This is, once in a lifetime

They gonna put me in a flight, no Priceline

Used to want to be in Marvel, fightin' crimes

You like your vodka with a little touch of lime

You should probably take your heels off

Cause you've been running through my mind

Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other

And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under

Your love's not too kind to me

I hate the pain these days of rain

You're playing games of hide and seek, my love

And I'm still trying to find you, I'm looking for you babe

And I'm still trying to find you, through sunshine or rain

I love you

Yeah, you got your stained glass iris

Diamond behind your eyelids, autopilot fly

My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD

Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi

Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy

Love is power

Swear there's something about her that make me nervous

Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect

Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus

Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it

So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it

Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses

Let's just go take a breath

I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left

You are my drug, in love to death

Feel free to fall, you are a catch

And I know that nothing lasts forever

Nothing lasts forever

Yeah, and she is cool, calm and collected

I knew that you was the one

When I seen you leave me breathless

Say okay I need a second day today, give me attention

I want to take care of you

Marry you, something I'm prepared to do, there can't be two

You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step

But now that I am ready, you're not, you up and left me

Hope your new man make you laugh like I do

I do not mean to worry you with my obsession

I just want to be beside you

I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price

Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right

Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby

Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy

Growing pains, fill the open veins with Novocain

Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain

I'm just rambling

You want war? It’s N64, Blitz Champion

Heavy rain game cancelling, proud to be American

There's an atom bomb inside of my hard drive

Just realized that I'm an idiot

Wearing my disguise, my real face is fucking hideous

My pretty bitch watching Insidious with her pussy out

Awww, Sookie Sookie now

Rapper terrorist, rarer than good parents is

Putting hard drugs inside of all your baby carriages

Arrogance, throwing cherry bombs where the sheriff lives

Just because that shit's hilarious

And I inherited the thirst for self-destruction and I'm scared of it

I wanna be buried with a novel and a chariot

I'm a bigger illusion than good marriages or what it means to be American

Stripped butt naked, caused a panic at the disco

Fell for the bimbo that was dancing at the strip show

I gotta stop thinking with my dick-hole

Stripped butt naked, caused a panic at the disco

Fell for the bimbo that was dancing at the strip show

A genius still thinking with his dick bone

Out in Wichita, Kansas, smoking meth with all the locals

Asking them to teach me how to yodel

Suppose I'll die alone from an overdose of some sort

In a motel while some whore fucking running to the drug store

I hacked into the motherboard, argued on a public forum

Uploaded a virus to the network then unplugged the cord

The laws are not important

If you scared lock your door then

I always feel like a foreigner

Morphing into some sort of sorcerer

I'm Yuri's brother if it's Lord of War

What would I be normal for?

I'm going door to door shooting porno's with a good script

I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book

Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look

All your songs are sixteen's and a hook

We're here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution

I'm dying for the movement, trying not to lose it

I could fly home with my eyes closed 

But it be kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though 

And you could find me , I ain't hidin' 

I don't move my feet when I be glidin' 

I just slide in and then I roll out

I didn't know, I didn't know

I didn't know, I didn't know, hey

Now I see a lil' different, I was, thinking too much

Got stuck in oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah

So for now I'm just chilling, plus I know it's a

It's a beautiful feeling in oblivion, yeah, yeah

Yeah, okay I ride around my city when I come home, yeah

The sun set quickly then get up slow, yeah

I disconnect and upload

Watch it spin around, we just spinnin' round, yeah

Let's go and travel through the unknown, yeah

We play it cool, we know we fucked though, yeah

You keep on sayin' you in love so

Tell me are you really down? Are you really down? Yeah

Let's go back to my crib and play some 45's

It's safer there, I know there's still a war outside

We spend our nights all liquored up, our mornings high

Can you feel it now?

Oblivion, yeah, yeah

Oblivion, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oohhh

Kids

Ha-ha

I'm just high, why they hatin' on me?

People tend to think all the drinks on me

I don't even have no money to spend

To buy Patron for you and all your friends

Baby, I be on my grind, rain, sleet, snow

Rollin' up good every place we go

'Cause we tryin' to get high, get high, get high

Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see

Little bit of this and a little bit of that

We proceed to give them what they need

Just wakin' up then gettin' stoned

Rub my eyes and check my phone

Open up the fridge to make some waffles

But no more syrup left in my bottle

Damn, well, it's okay

I top it off with scrambled eggs

Ayy, gotta work with watcha got

Ayy, gotta work with watcha got

Supposed to be in class but I ain't goin'

Let's chill on the couch

See what's on the telly

Girl, we won't leave the house

Can ya stay a while?

Can ya stay a while?

'Cause girl I'm feelin' lazy

And I'm tryna hang around

Ain't tryna get out of my bed till noon

Neighbors smell the perfume smoke in my room

And I got the door closed can't be sure though

Amsterdam weed, spendin' euro's

Get the herb rolled,let's relax

Take your shoes off and kick it back

We escaped the world, escaped the stress

But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess

Cause we gonna handle that later, we gonna handle that later

Right now lets get this paper and smile for all them haters

Aye cream cheese and a bagel, have a glass of milk and an eggo

I'm rockin' PJ's and no shirt, I smoke weed, eat yogurt

Haha, enjoy the best things in your life

Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice

They say you waste time asleep, But I'm just tryin' to dream

Supposed to be in class but I ain't goin'

Let's chill on the couch

See what's on the telly

Girl, we won't leave the house

Can ya stay a while?

Can ya stay a while?

'Cause girl I'm feelin' lazy

And I'm tryna hang around

Hardcore pound fucking. That's the shit, right there.

No, no, no, no. Hell yeah. Yo, that’s the only way to do it, man. It’s that boom boom boom, man.

And I don't mean ill like really cool and awesome

I mean like, I'm comin' down with a sickness

Well I was ridin' in shotgun, speedin' down the highway

Listenin' to music, haven’t slept in like five days

I tried to take a nap, lean my head against the window

It feels real, I swear to God this shit pretend, though

'Cause, me, I get high, make music for a living

If that ain’t the best job, then give me your opinion

'Cause I love life, chillin' for the night, case of Bud Light

Small world for me, but you, you live a Bug's Life

Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk

Think its make believe, so you hate the shit

Valentine love it, grimier than rubbish

You softer then a Snuggie and you sweeter then a Sunkist

Never eatin' beets on your Doug shit

Come with all the swagger, but you lackin' all the substance

Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school

Spendin' money, drinkin' liquor, naked girls up in my pool

Wake up in my bed, gettin’ head, she said

The act so cool but she easily impressed

I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed

Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes

Today a new day, a fresh start

If you didn’t make mistakes, you wouldn't get far

Life get hard, so we get high, you ain't shit till you try

Ay, yo, my herb smoke tasting like a Nerds rope

I'mma get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat

Something like a millionaire in training

Still my shit amazing, we jumpin' over puddles when it's raining

Planning on a tan, I’m in the sand

And we'll be jammin', make it bounce

While we dancing on the clouds until I’m landing in my house

Remember when my moms would hate me standing on the couch

But now I’m making so much money I start to lose count

I try and spend it quick, I got bills though

Yeah I’m only eighteen, I got skills though

Beats, Rhymes, Life, Tribe Called Chill Flow

You been rapping twenty-five years and you still broke

No disrespect, the riches is the art

I’m just mad at all these haters who was bitches from the start

We just do this 'cause we love it and it's setting us apart

We was already gone while you was only on your mark"

So finally I made a fuckin' song

And now she comin' closer

Hope she crawls, she wanna jump my bones

You want it don't ya?

I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over

Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break

You need to smell your sweet aroma

See I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips

I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix

My dick on business trips

My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit

I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river

In the Caribbean

It's okay that you like it babe 

And it's alright that you misbehave

It's okay to be this way 

To live this way baby baby

Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall

All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on

Why would I ever blow you off?

Right now, let's go get lost

Just I've been way too hot for way too long

I'm so exhausted

Whether that's your mind or line we still get crossed

First your name is gone

Never understand until you have to stand alone

Can I have a hand to hold?

A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold

I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes

They didn't want a man when it was; man I'm broke

But now they know me and what I don't need

I think I know it all but I don't

Why you always at the mall when you broke? Yeah

And I just wanna ball

Maybe dunk but I've never been tall, yeah

I might trip, I never fall

God knows I've came close 

I know I probably need to do better, fuck whoever

Keep my shit together

You never told me being rich was so lonely

Nobody know me, oh well

Hard to complain from this five star hotel

I'm always in a rush, I've been thinking too much but

Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us

No need for shame, I get more peace at slow speeds

Go beat the game, young control freak

It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezing, snow season 

They know that I so need my space

Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case

She say that I glow below the waist

And the stroke is just so PGA

All I got is a little bit of space and time

Drawing shapes and lines of the world we made

Tomorrow may be right around the corner

But I swear it's gon' be worth it if I make you wait

There's somewhere above, you keep reaching up

That's really all it takes

Yeah, nine times out of 10 I get it wrong

That's why I wrote this song, told myself to hold on

I can feel my fingers slippin'

In a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone

Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?

Staring at the wall and the wall's full of posters

Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be

I guess you gotta see it to believe

Oh, I been a fool but it's cool, that's what human beings do

Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes

Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed

But the sun coming out now, clouds start to move

Don't tell me nothing but the truth

I'm tired, I don't gotta spare a second

Tell them haters, call your army, bring your tanks

Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks

Work until I get it, I bet it's gon' take a second

But once I start up my engine, I'm gone, too fast to catch him

I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink

What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days

Sweeter than creme brulee, presidential head of state

Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade

Elevate, Buddha shit, cooler than what coolest is

Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it

Stupid bitch, keep on hatin', I'ma keep on doin' it

Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick

And bring it back

I could change the world with just a single track

Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak

Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at

On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact

I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball

After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall

Now the ladies all say I dress well

With a nice pair of jeans, LRG or Evisu

Crew neck sweatshirt, hat and some clean shoes

Pockets stayed equipped with some paper and some gold piff

Pack of gum, squares, Blackberry and a phone clip

Got Most dope Clique, bunch of mothafuckers lookin' fresh

Crooks and castle dress, sloppy sloppy haters shouldn't mess

Walkin' by your lady and I'm sorry if I took her breath

You was just baby, cryin' til you end up shook to death

 fade away like an Etch A Sketch

Don't second guess, ain't nobody better dressed

Text hoes wearin' less clothes than her mama like

Church girl, always go to school, she the honest type

But when it comes to boys she like 'em bad

So holla at the kid I got swag

Had some baggy gear, now my clothes tailored 

Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback 

Knick knack paddy whack, give that boy some clothes

Imitate the kid, you may get yourself some hoes

Sometimes I think about this time next year

Grinding to the fullest kicking rhymes for your ears

I wonder if they hear me now, coming fresh with a style

The illest child always chilling with a smile

Cause hip-hop waitin' for me back at home, we just need to have a little time alone

Because lately I've been living life by my phone

Tryin' to do business, mind on my dough

Woah, hold up, let me take a rest

Bring your back with my dogs like I'm playing fetch

I'm trying to be the future, molding the CD

Something bumping out the system all repeat

My minds elevated like ET

Work hard in quick sand, knee deep

You know I'm always doing double like a re-read

It's like I played the whole game with a cheat sheet

Dollar signs to my name like Too Short

Gonna go broke with this tax no newport

I'm unhealthy, working to succeed

Trying to spit out more words than I can read

Staying up late, keep burning through this weed

When the radio came on, fuck around and get based on

Do this shit 'til the day I die, are you ready, are you ready?

Terrified but my hand is steady, verified, get the camera ready

Carry my own weight, all these earthquakes don't wake

Me up from this deep sleep, diving into this cold lake

Fuck a bitch til her toes shake, telling me I'm her soul-mate

Disguised emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks

Dealing with it since '08, fucked around, now I'm done

And I heard you're supposed to race

When you hear the sound of that gun

Now it's losing all of its fun, spending days in solitude

Too many dumb interviews, put me in this awful mood

Not thinking logical, getting high, jump off the moon

Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital

Peace don't seem possible, when the mind is so closed

Came in for your money, then left with all of your hoes

Life move fast but my baby keep it slow

Open up your mind start forgetting what you know

Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone

You hurt so good, girl your loving hurt so good

Love me, love me, that fentanyl it numb me

Beautiful it get ugly, turn you into a junkie

Still searching for something, but I don't know what

Dreaming about nothing, wake you up and then fuck

I love it when you get a little nasty

Hit it from the back, if you like that, wiggle them ass cheeks

Isn't that sweet, same shit we did last week

'fore all the cash, you might stood up and would've walked passed me

Wake me up from this bad dream, put a match to this gasoline

Every night you somebody different, got me thinking it's Halloween

Fucked up, I can't feel myself, work hard might kill myself

Exist through audio, but all my problems that's real as hell

Trapped in this wishing well, death creeping like Splinter Cell

Getting high, blew my mind away

Find the words to what I'm tryna say

...I'mma think of that later

When the world goes against you, better get that paper

Life move fast but my baby keep it slow

Open up your mind start forgetting what you know

Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone

You think you a God 'til you run out of time

Yeah, do I belong sometime soon, where goes my mind?

You were the one to show me

Divine love, love, love, love

Where was you when I was lonely

My divine love, love, love, love?

Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?

I'm right here...

Yeah, why do you stay on my case?

I try to make you feel okay

Do you know I'm in pain?

I give you clues, you misconstrue

You continue to push me far away

Why don't you come on in?

It's like you forgot my face

I just wanna taste of everything you're made of

We ain't 

Cut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly

Yeah, when are you coming through to free my mind?

Are you happy with your life?

Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside

When you take off all your clothes, I'm under your control

Rollin' up, you get me high

You were the one to show me

Divine love, love, love, love

Where was you when I was lonely

My divine love, love, love, love?

When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so clear

Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?

I'm right here..."

You know, its been so dark outside

That I figured I'd turn a couple motherfuckin' lights on real quick

Uh, I ain't talkin 'bout nothin' with a flow so disgutin'

Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in

Need substance, feed it to the public

No one gon' touch it like my Poppy's old musket

Roll up to the function, eatin' all the Funyuns

Sentence keep runnin', word to double E Cummings

People say to me that it doesn't mean nothin'

Bumble bees buzzin' cause the trouble needs lovin'

Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?

Those are the people to which I dedicate this rap today

Your shit is fragile, If I have to, I'mma crack your face

Monday to Saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case

While Sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my Callaway's

Or watchin' football, word to Joey Galloway

Take a shower start singin' like Al Green

From outside, it probably sound like some loud screams

Always had child dreams and nightmares

My music like the airport I hop on a flight there

Wanna go to Monaco to see what its like there

Roll up in a pair of Nike Airs, just like ""yeah""

Wassup, here I am, lookin' in the mirror and

All I see is me, I'm at peace

Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems

The things I regret now, be gone by the mornin'

My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been

Pencilin' my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes

Number 1 albums, always givin' you mixtapes

And that's what I'mma do until I'm richer than Bill Gates

It ain't all about money for me though

I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego

Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend though

Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to Cee Lo

Bottles of Clicquot, a couple of Cristal

May head to L.A like I'm Chris Paul

Bout to go platinum off of ""Missed Calls""

So all of y'all can lick balls

Yeuhhh

Just you know

Run from the dark

Into the light

You know, you know you're gona find your way out

Run from the dark

Into the light

Oh-woah, you know you're gona find your way

Just run to the sunlight

Just run to the sunlight

Just run to the sunlight

This is an outrage! 

As a matter of fact, this is outrageous! 

Hahahah, yeah

Young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer

Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina

Like I want kids, my head continues to be haunted

I burn a city down while I'm unconscious

Maybe gon' and take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesús

Batting practice with the mothafuckin' ghost of Babe Ruth

Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful

Devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail

 Right there

And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target

Then I don't know why I even started

I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light

Told myself, ""Fuck the world kid, just do what you like

Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life

You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity

But all those big words ain't gon' get you paid

And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid

You got it made in that mad house

What the fuck you got to be sad 'bout? Go 'head and rap now

Do what you do best

I mean, that's what you do best

Matter fact mothafucka, you suit vest, you need to buy a new dress

I heard you and your girl live in a duplex

I'ma put her ass in a suplex, the sun east, the moon west

You got a clue, what does a clue get? Nothing""

My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore

My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway

Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow

And the lion through the forest

To the Wicked Witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay

Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard

When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard

Now the whole world's in color, still

How Auntie Em was next of kin but not her mother, real

Her face was careworn, I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn

And had beef with Mrs. Gulch from the very beginning of year one

Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic

The poetry's like the poems and psalms of Ecclesiastes

Lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet

The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet

And yell ""Hear hear"", finally some order to this rap shit

Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips

I keep my shit crispy and elegant

So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent

The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford

Brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal

Every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca

Shout out to Tony Toca, we ballin' like we suppose to..."

Through a pound ready for another round

Some hoes in the back of the whip and they rollin servin

Pussy like the U.S Open blowin on this

Potent different flavors I done saw em all I be stayin

Higher than the Taj Mahal straight epic

So now you can't forget it kickin girls out the crib

Like they got some bad credit when you blowed

And you drunk and you dont give a fuck take this soul

And this funk tell the Dj turn it up purple

Stuff got it stirrin in my cup while ho*es I get around

Like the wheels on the bus im'a true player

Original mac and I keep the pussy poppin here listen

To that hoes showin me some love so im givin

It back she wanna be mrs.mac how you figure that?

Go on and ride me like a swing set, Go on and ride me like a swing set, Up and down, up and down, Ride me like a swing set

Ride, swerve, thats how you do it in the burbs

When you high off the herb and you fly as a bird

With some horny hoes waitin in the burbs

You gotta go, lookin fresh with the cap on

And your girlie still wet from the last song

Ladies like mac miller ooh I wanna merry him

If it's sex and drugs then I'm heroin

I Pick her up just to ride around

Twistin' somethin' purple have us flyin' to a higher ground

She love ridin' with the kid right here

Shes still gon' be in love this time next year

Cuz im a, Heartbreaker, mover and shaker

She love watchin' what I do with my paper

Love it how I player

Loud like a banger

Staying on track like I’m following a train

And I’m grinding like your teeth when you angry

Go ahead cry yourself to sleep you a baby

Just a bum gotta hand you some change

Too smart

Y’all can call me Andy Dufresne

Still gotta inbox full of texts

And hoes tell me that I make a great first impression

Never stick around so they never learn they lesson

Hit it then I’m Nick Cage

Gone in sixty seconds

But you already know that pimping

Fish outta water need to go back swimming

They tripping

Every time I’m rolling they dipping

Cause my style “doh!”

I wanna rush the ball, I wanna buy it all by myself, fuck y'all

See, I'm ridin' in my ocean waves, so blaze, I toast the haze

I coast for days, and we stay for a lil' bit pic

Take a sniff of that flava flave, I ain't tailor made 

I'ma take what I can, the first in line with a cake in my hand

And I seen y'all sink in the sand

That's money in the bank, mo' cheese for the team

And I do it for the cream, and the love for the scene

And the cuss for the on the jeans

And I leave the receivin' team, which they didn't catch up

'Til they flee from the scene

You don't really want it, boy, you better back down

Tell your girl turn around, bring it back now

Tell me why she wanna ride on my style

Gotta scream my name so loud that she black out

Act now if you wanna get it crackin'

So when I pause for action

Watch out dawg, 'cause I ball for the passion

My bars is blendin', leave you sittin' up for mores in seconds

Leave you scarred for weapons, I could battle you hard from detention

Yup, a mic blessing, givin' little tights lessons

I'm grindin', let my chest bling

Rhymin' during testing, you would acted like on the west wing

Chess king, checkmate, the chessboard is mine

You wanna war with rhymes? The tourin' God explores your mind

You a borderline bitch fuckin' with pork and swine

Your spinal cord is gettin' popped like a cork in wine

I'm recordin' mine, what I'm sippin' on

I need that ice in my watch, feel like my wrist is gone

That's the shit I'm on, listen through it in the car

Let me get a little bit more beat

Yeah

Ask God if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity

And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free

I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave

I took a nap, beneath a tree in the shade

Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass

Picturing the images that make you laugh

I left you out to die, but will you take me back?

Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious

She's naked underneath them shadows

Let the sunlight undress her slow

I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doing impressions though

I'm going to the festival, the festival need to let me go

I wake up, pop a couple Benadryls, go back to sleep

It's all made up, everything they said was real, it has to be

Cause actually the master fast asleep

And the castles back back in his private quarters 

That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order 

All this torture, thought I had to warn you

Leave it all behind and go to California

I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzing this feeling

You can't fathom 

My hands are ahead the clouds

From the clap-clap thunder looking down

While you're running around

I lift you up when you drown

Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation

Full speed chasing and you're always running ahead

You're always running ahead

You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances

And you battle like a champion, why

Do you wanna go, do you wanna go

Do you wanna go to the festival

You got angels weeping, we can see them dripping from the sky

You watch 'em with your third eye 

Do you wanna go, do you wanna go

Do you wanna go to the festival 

To the festival 

To the festival 

Festival

Uh, You know the finer things in life, you know

Sometimes you gotta kick back and enjoy that shit

Look, just relax

I like sittin' in shotgun, deuce on a L

Parents not carin' cause they used to the smell

Classy Ass Women, fresh Ass linen

Hot summer days with a pool I can swim in

A good spot to kick it, a case of 40's

Them homies always havin' good stories

The beer bottles with the twist off caps

When old people tell you that they listen to rap

I love days I can sleep in, four day weekends

Hoes puttin' they clothes back on, you peekin'

Blunt rides, with a mixtape bumpin'

I love makin' love in public

And when the Hip-Hop legend tour comin' to your town

Findin' a crispy ass twenty on the ground

Walkin' when the sun out, watchin' Run's House

Or action movies when the villain pull his gun out

The best things in life is the free ones

The little things everybody need some

The finer things make you feel better

But no one ever seem to remember

I like sleepin' in class and cheatin' to pass

Hoes walkin' in the halls and you reach for they ass

Fast food lines when they movin' so quickly

When your weed man hit you with some sticky

Street performers, warmin' up the corners

Sellin' by the ounce, then pinchin' by the quarter

When some kicks on sale

Wakin' up in the mornin' with a shit load of mail

The wake up, the bake up, chillin while you face blunts

Goin' in blowed for your shape up, like say what?

Blog put your tape up, get a good review

When dumbass people tell you what you shouldn't do

When she rub my head while I'm between her knees

Gettin love from the people overseas

Haters tryin' to hate, but they got nothin' to say

It's just the little things that get me through the day

The best things in life is the free ones

The lil things everybody need some

The finer things make you feel better

But no one ever seem to remember

Like I said before, it's your boy, Mac Miller

They tryin' to tell me I couldn't do this beat

Know what I said? I didn't say nothin'

I just went in the booth and did it

Somebody tell Will to get some malt liquor next time"

Put a little gin in the punch

Grandma getting crunked, just fine

Nobody give a fuck

All these days already gone by

Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time

The door's open, I might as well just stroll in

Got some Arnie Palmer in my pitcher: call it Nolan

Ryan, try it once and then you go there

I am hoping that we can kick it

Reminiscing only about the good times

I know there's moments

When you probably love me but you didn't wanna show it

Now I'm all around the globe

With everyone but you

I know you fuckin miss me

Chill and keep it cool! Never getting old mane

Grown, no Rogaine. Boy you play with all that food

You better eat the whole thing!

It's a family reunion, all the grandmas be moving

Running in 3-legged races people would cry if they losing

When I was 2, my fly was blue

When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand

When my, bike was all I was riding on

Jewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it I was happy still

Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill

Come and, step inside the Electric Slide

Spraying squirt guns at you like it's pesticides

So why you buggin'... lil man stop bugging...

I gotta, spend some time, with some friends of mine

Get away from everything, go and rest your mind

It's not nothing... lil man it's not nothing...

All my little cousins acting like some munchkins

Running in the trees and they're crying out their eyes

Have to rush em to the ER - maybe just a Band-Aid will do it

You can sing along please, let the band play the music

Always nice when you come back home

Your friends go off but then they come back grown

Nice to know that you're never alone

Family reunions whenever I'm home..

Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill

It's a muthafuckin barbeque for real

Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works

She make me feel like how them drugs work

Itchin' for my fixture, when she gone the love hurts

I just get a temper, I just need somebody I can vent to

Someone get me stoned, be my Emma

Left your lipstick on the glass of your daiquiri

Ruby red, usually end up tragically

Work of art, you can be my masterpiece

But you fast asleep

Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more

Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before

I hope one day it all makes sense

It'll all make sense

And you could have it all, tell me what you need

Believin' all them silly things you read

I hope one day it all makes sense

One day it'll all make sense

Uh

Now she wake up, cryin' while she puttin' on her make-up

Trapped inside her love for me, ain't no escape for

Her, you wanna leave?

Say the word, but she can't

Lookin' in my eyes, ""Is everything okay?""

She lies, put on her disguise, play it safe

'Cause we've been fightin' for the past three weeks

She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak

Strong, baby, tell me what's been goin' on

I don't wanna be sober long

So you need to get me high again

I got all this money we could try to spend

Until we strung out like a violin

Come back to life, then we die again

Little angel, where's your halo?

Somewhere above them horns

Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more

Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before

I hope one day it all makes sense

It'll all make sense

And you could have it all, tell me what you need

Believin' all them silly things you read

I hope one day it all makes sense

One day it'll all make sense

Uh

You get me high, girl, scared to overdose

I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose

May I propose a toast? Someone usually does

To our fucked up love

You get me high, girl, scared to overdose

I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose

May I propose a toast? Someone usually does

To our fucked up love

Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more

Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before

*Snorts*

*Exhales*

And you could have it all, tell me what you need

Believin' all them silly things you read

Don't cry, it's okay

It'll all be over soon"
349,The Question,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-the-question-lyrics,Macadelic,True,"Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am

Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am

Uhhhhhh

Yeah, want you to feel it

I want you all to feel it

So step up on the mic and uhh

Show them what you got tiger

Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am

So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense

I'm askin' what am I supposed to do?

I've done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit

I done flew around the whole world

First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures

But I'm a hostage in my own world

And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches

I got too much on my damn mind

So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'm a cope

I think they underestimate the grind

I do, bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old

I wonder why I sip this devil juice

Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several

Thank God that none of that medical

Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

What am I doing here?

I wonder what am I doing here

What am I doing here

What am I doing here

I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever

I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground

I hope I do what I was meant to do

Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now

Please, let me find euphoria

When you up above the clouds, like, who goin' to touch me now

And do we ever get to know the truth?

Cause everyone seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it

Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean

Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love

Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed

And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough

Wonder why it's me instead of you

I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several

Thank God that none of that medical

Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

What am I doing here?

I wonder what am I doing here

What am I doing here

What am I doing here

Uh, sittin' in my Bentley, thinkin' bout these hoes

All I do is kill them, I kill them like Nicole

Simpson, flag crimson, smoke em' like Winstons

I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant

I'm lightin' up a stogie, It's longer than a hoagie

Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies

Fuck the world, kill em' all, she answer when I call

If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers

See I come from a place where stars never shine

And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined

Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody

If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard

I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important

I'm just tryna to buy time, but can't really afford it

Sayin' ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad

I feel like money in the trash, like—

Whoa! Yeah, Young Mula Baby!

What am I doing here?

I wonder what am I doing here

What am I doing here

What am I doing here"

That Mercedes all kinds of roomy, and when the time's are gloomy

Hit me up, I can make you feel like the perfect girl you wish you was

Givin' you that feeling like when Christmas come

Got a shortcut, baby? I'll pass on it, my dick, throw your ass on it 

Pass the time, ask for my alibi, tryna tell you I need that

 Just relax 

Put that money in my motherfucking hand

Take another pull, Goddamn

Ain't part of the plan, like a car in a van

I'm rollin', I'm feelin' good, I'm golden

My man, let me just do my dance

'Cause, motherfucker, this my jam, said this my jam, this my jam

How many times you 'bout to let them opportunities pass you by?

I used to be a pretty passive guy, since before I was a Goddamn mastermind

In that castle of mine, I came up in half the time as these lame fucks

You can't rush that greatness, that mansion where my maid lives

I can take you anywhere you wanna go

Free liquor out the bar and the brightest fucking stars up in heaven

Heard that you can chill, not worry about the police

Not worry about someone fighting cause everything's just at peace

Heard the streets paved with gold, the women all gorgeous

You just float, can’t even feel where the floor is

I heard heaven got a brand new venue

Next to that restaurant, you love their menu

And everything free, so everyone cool

Look out any window, it’s an incredible view

Everyone you speak to always telling you the truth

And it’s only good shit when you gettin’ all your news

Ooh, ahh, Imagine that, just a place that we can kick it

And be happy at, satisfaction or maybe I’m dreamin

I’ll tell you what it’s like when I see it

If you hear what heaven’s like, can you tell me?

Please, I’m really trying to know

Cuz I do what I do, when it’s all said and done

Shit, I’m just tryin' to go

If you hear what heaven’s like, could you tell me?

Please, I’m really tryin' to know

Cuz I do what I do, when it’s all said and done

Shit, I’m just trying to go

I heard ain’t nobody famous up in heaven, everybody the same

Just kick it up there in heaven 'cuz nobody gonna change

Nobody can complain, the parties are all insane

The people all know your name, shit you entertain

See everybody you want, always keep in touch and

Go and chill by yourself when everything get too much

Never a fucking rush, you're there for a million plus

You probably got a Mercedes, but always could take the bus

So fuck, that's what heaven’s like

I guess think it is

Come to think of it, I’ve been drinkin shit

I don't know the truth

It’s what I imagined when I was standin' in the booth

If you hear what heaven’s like, can you tell me?

Please, I’m really trying to know

Cuz I do what I do, when it’s all said and done

Shit, I’m just tryin' to go

Oh, Hi!

Welcome back to K.I.D.S. uhm…..

Follow your dreams?...

Yeah!

I wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi

A theater to watch my movies

A couple whips and lots of fancy things

The kids they call the Goonies

I, see the future, crystal ball

Mirror, mirror hangin' on the wall

Who the flyest white boy of them all?

Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls

She bubblin', we fuckin' then you cuddlin'

Like baby where the fuck you been?

Don't wanna tell you she in love with him

So! so! we ain't sayin' nothin'

You could probably tell she bluffin'

Cause she kiss you with the mouth

She gave me head with my concussion

Yeah she blushin', all red

Wanna rush and go to bed

You interrogate that bitch like you the Feds

So she says, she in love with a rockstar, rockstar

Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, top drawer

Oh, oh, oh

Honey I need you 'round

I know, I know

Oh, oh, oh

Honey I need you 'round

I know, I know

These hoes is drunk, wanna come and smoke this blunt

Then let me take 'em home and do anything I want

I say: ""Baby I can ride ya, just let me get inside ya

I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizer""

I got that dope dick, I'll be your supplier

You grabbin' on my sheets and hittin' notes like you Mariah

Obsessed with me; wanna dress a freak on ecstasy

I'm out and then she textin' me

Like: ""What you doin' next week, next week?""

Hear me now

I'm down on knees and praying

Though my faith is weak

Without you so please baby please

Give us a chance

Make amends and I will stand up till the end

A million times, a trillion times

Oh, oh, oh

Honey I need you 'round

I know, I know

Oh, oh, oh

Honey I need you 'round

355,The Star Room,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-the-star-room-lyrics,Watching Movies With the Sound Off,True,"Hallelujah, thank God I have a future

Praying I don't waste it getting faded

Cause I'm smoking *censored* 'til I'm coughing up tar

Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar

I don't act hard, I still read Babar

Tripping out, looking at a bunch of Google map stars

Shit, they got a app for... that

But me, I'm still trapped inside my head

It kinda feel like it's a purgatory

So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me

Think I'm living paradise, so would I have to worry 'bout?

Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure

Find the perfect style

Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love

All these backfires of my experiments with drugs

And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form

The difference between love and war inform me

I'm above the norm

But, give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts

Rhyming like it's summertime on asphalt, hot

Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed

I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls

Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?

I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice

And I don't know what I'm running from, but I'm running still

I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real

I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel

So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal

Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil

But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove

So, if you ain't talking 'bout some money I'mma send you home

Unconventional, special but unprofessional

Adolescent expression that's letting me meet these centerfolds

As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go

If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow

That's just me all wilding out and being extra doe

And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly, watching horror movies

With some foreign groupies, thinking this decor suits me

I do drugs to get more loopy, I'm in tune

To ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful

Looking out as far as eyes can see

I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet

I think I'm JFK's final speech

They try assassinating all of my beliefs

But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind

And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine

Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time

If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine

Can't decide if you like all the fame

Three years ago to now, it's just not the same

I'm looking out my window ashing on the pane

Shit, wonder if I lost my way

Don't you ever wanna hide away

Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain

Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today

I'll greet the devil with a smiling face

Shit, that God fellow may reside in space

As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with Freemasons

My girl's switching the locks, the keys keep changing

Dreaming of places, my own personal creations

If there's a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted

Retracing my steps way back to Biblical times

We-we all gon' end up meeting at the finishing line

And these words that I command you today shall be in your heat

And you shall teach them diligently to your children

And you shall speak of them when you sit at home

And when you walk along the way, and when you lie down

And when you rise up, I am the lord, your god"

I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station

Packing no bags, nothing but the clothes on my back

With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryna relax

Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon

I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan

Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on

I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't staying long

What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?

I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen

Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me

Well, I made it big and, everybody phony

Ha, so could you pour me, I need a cup

No, none of that liquor, mix some purple stuff

I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much

Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

They just dreams, turn 'em to reality

Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony

Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine

I don't know, what the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?

What do you do when you think you could be an icon?

Cause all these people get to screaming with the lights on

Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat

Racing to the gate but my flight gone

And now these writers taking shots without a Nikon

But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo

Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though

Potion in my sprite, then my night slows... down, down

See, that's exactly what I need

My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat

Like it was ""Donald Trump,"" a fucking hit but I just call it luck

They throw it on when I'm walking in the club

Hey, this the Burgh shit, I don't deserve this

Well, I don't think you looking far beyond the surface

Learn quick, now I'm big time

Fill your cup up, and I'mma sip mine

But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims

This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons

I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though

Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?

I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?

Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest

I'm an honest man

My mama told me never put it on the lotto and

I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam

So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram, goddamn

I'm goin' up before I skydive

Time flies, try to catch it

Watch as time go

Time moves, time flows

How do we handle these things?

I am time, we are time and we have control

One thing we need to remember

Is that we are all in this together

You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams are manifested

From my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive

But I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings

All the times that I've been reckless with an ego big as Texas

Thinkin' ""I'm the man"", I never let these hoes inside the plan

My room for bullshit in the crib as small as a child's hands

I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand

I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah

I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road

Even though I know they need me at home

Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold

Each to their own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high

Always twist a couple spiffs while I'm in the whip

Tell my homie at the register to stay up

Going through the tunnel bout to break up

Phone gets hanged up, tunes turned way up the max

Hit the L twice then pass it to the back breath

Ain't no pause or hesitation, trying to catch my respiration

I ain't never had no patience, so I'm hardly ever waiting

Sink all these cats with false representation

Two bigger words maybe need some translation

Dreams I gotta follow you

Love is what I'm falling to

And ever do I follow through

So ima put it all on you

Just know that I ain't got a clue

Hurt me when I watch the news

But all their chances is impossible

Giving the word like literature spitting the verse

For all of those who live in the Berg

I travel the word the land and the sea

Here to open up your mind

Just hand me the key

Memories don't live like people do, they always remember you

Whether things are good or bad, it's just the memories

Memories don't live like people do baby don't forget me

I'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time

Got a lot of things I got to do

But lord willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo

I'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time

Got a lot of things I got to do

But god willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo"
374,Two Matches,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-two-matches-lyrics,GO:OD AM,True,"When I was just a kid

Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich

No more problems and no more tricks

I set my sights high cause in my lifetime

Man, I've seen some shit

Yeah, I swear to God

I've seen some muthafuckin' shit

Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? 

Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish

What's a life if you never take a risk?

Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big

Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun 

Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

In my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y

Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor 

Long story short, that's one of my longterm goals

My anatomy is platinum, gold is old

Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang

I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades

Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums

Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade

But can't we all just get along?

Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day

She say ""Soulo, you so crazy and deranged"", I say I know

Roll that weed nigga! 

Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash

Sounwave on the beat and our key is anarchy

Your confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze

Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia

Soul!

Yeah, I've seen some shit 

How'd I end up in a place like this? 

Swear to God, seen some shit

Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is

In this lifetime, be the time of your life

It's been a while but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike

And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest

Curse words were probably my first words, affirmative

My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park

Even the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes

I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize

Had to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long

I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish

From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger

I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer

Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure

I'm a goner

Shootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer

Better find that thing you die for

I don't know why what I get so high for

I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma

You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes

There was a time...

When I was just a kid

Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich

No more problems and no more tricks

I set my sights high cause In my lifetime

Man, I've seen some shit

Yeah, I swear to God

I've seen some muthafuckin' shit

Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?

Take your time

Don't close your eyes

Life happens in a flash

And you don't wanna miss that

Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish

What's a life if you never take a risk?

Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big

Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun 

Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

Yeah, I've seen some shit 

How'd I end up in a place like this? 

Swear to God, seen some shit

Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is

We all grow up to be gangstas, playas, snitches

Freaks and strangers, politicians

Good and evil people

Sinners, saints and everything in between

Wicked as Aleister Crowley, know﻿ me

Lately I've been thinkin' 

I've, I've been thinkin'

What's the difference? What's the difference?

Nothing at all! 

Aye, let me just add one more thing, Josh

Aye, aye, watch that shit man, you almost burnt me nigga!"

Took the pins out my hand grenade?

I looked him in the eye and said the devil's not circumcised

Who put spiders in my applesauce?

Took the pins out my hand grenade?

Somebody told that I deserve to die

I looked him in the eye and said the devil not circumcised

So play me a song on the guitar

Got a rainforest in my cigar

There's knots in my yo-yo string

Put a crown on my stallion, I'm the Polo king

I fell in love with a go-go dancer, she's a single mom

The underdog, I like to play the game with Diddy Kong

She the god type, throw that bitch a Klondike

Everything is alright, see it's written in the Psalms

I told her I get rich off my little songs

Gave her a billion reasons that she should come along

Immediately, she dropped her shit

But everywhere I go, they tell me ""Watch your bitch!""

God damn! I guess I got another one

Good vibrations, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch

I put the gourmet flavors inside the honey blunt

Got my head underwater but I ain't comin' up

Fuck air, my bitch's ass is like a plump pear

And she ain't pretty or ugly, I say she's just fair

Man this life is unfair

Okay I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to lose

And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two

Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?

I said I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to do

And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two

Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?

I'm readin' old Playboy magazines

Somethin' from the 50's when the journalism had its peak

You play the background, you just a member of the faculty

I'm actually out here decision makin'

Had to get my shit together, I was missin' payments

I just pray to God that my lady isn't famous

She threw the gown on and we hit the banquet

She got her own story; just let the bitch explain it:

Mac, I think the girl that you speakin' 'bout

Was, in fact, the same chick, late night, creepin' out

Sneakin' out, my homie knew it, told me keep an eye

Found out she was twerkin', found out she wasn't workin'

The whole game switched when my man hit

Got me rollin' in a circle, top-down, blowin' purple

Seen the parkin' lot, I'm 'bout to crawl up like a turtle

Seen the parkin' lot, I'm 'bout to crawl up like a turtle

Swang, switchin' lane to lane, still tippin'

Trunk up, top down, call it parkin' lot pimpin' 

Switchin' lane to lane, still tippin'

Trunk up, top down, call it parkin' lot pimpin'

Okay I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to lose

And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two

Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?

I said I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to do

And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two

Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank

I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break

But fuck it that's fine, not a minute go to waste

I just want to be a legend. Every second I gotta be goin' in

A part of me wanna chill, but part of me wanna win

No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel

Cause haters be lookin' stupid, when you just keepin' it real

I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit

But the people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am

Just because they random dudes I went to school with

I'm cool with it, chillin' with some buddah smoke

I always do it big like a Jewish nose

Cadillacs, I'm tryna to get a few of those

Fuck stress, everything'll be okay

How did you know

I was feeling so under the weather

This evening

If you don’t mind

Come rest your mind

I think it's all gon' be okay

And they say they love you, but they kiddin'

They say they bought your CD, but they didn't

If you don’t mind

Come rest your mind

I think it's all gon' be okay

Do you believe in fairytales, dreams come true?

One day you gone make it

If they gave you hand out, and you were down bad

Would you take it?

I found that bein' famous in reality, well it ain’t shit

Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand

But it don’t mean a thing ‘til you change it

Listen, baby, I'mma be great now

We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late

I’mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer

When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older

They turned a cold shoulder to me

And now they want tickets to my shows for the free

""Hey Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?""

Bitch suck my dick

How did you know

I was feeling so under the weather

This evening

If you don’t mind

Go front, back, side to side

Wave, say hi if I'm riding by

I know it sucks with a 9 to 5

But everything'll be alright

We go front, back, side to side

Wave, say hi if I'm riding by

I know it sucks with a 9 to 5

But everything'll be alright

Under the weather, shit'll get better

Under the weather, shit'll get better

The hatin' gonna last forever so

I just smile, it's whatever

Under the weather, shit'll get better

Under the weather, shit'll get better

Don't let nobody say you can't, heart beating like an 808

I know it sucks with a 9 to 5, but everything'll be alright

Go front, back, side to side

I know it sucks with a 9 to 5

But you ain't drunk enough until you takin' off your clothes

Not me, you can do you

Do some crazy shit that's poppin' up on Youtube

Finna rock out, I ain't talkin' U2

Passing out, waking up without shoes

Live life on the edge, sharper than a razor

Like my liquor straight, I don't ever need no chaser

Have a good time, ain't no reason we should fight

Well, I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met

The other day while I was on my break to smoke a cigarette

I hit her up, she had some weed and told me come through we should smoke

Bring a pair of L’s, don't bring no money, baby, I ain't broke

So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch

Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor

The door had opened up and it was her, she told me, ""hurry come right in""

Leave your shoes up by the furnace, cause we just put new carpets in

She asked me bout my day then sat me down

Told me we should have some fun, there ain't nobody around

She got this crazy pill the other day while she was on her way to work

Told me it would make my problems go away and fix the hurt

That I had, well, that don't sound bad

Down the hatch, kinda nervous, just relax, she said rubbing on my back

Well I ain't really into drugs but fuck it

I'mma take a trip and I'mma love it

I don't know what happened to me

But as soon as it hit me I was fuckin' free

It took me, to somewhere off the map

And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back

Well, I left right after that and started drivin' to my house where I reside

I was high and possibly a little fuckin' out my mind

Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house

I said fuck it, took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out

And it's funny cause I didn't even hit against the road

I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own

I see colors, different colors, like they glowin' in the light

They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark, but it was bright

That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take

If this kill me, I'mma come back, haunt her every single day

As I wait sittin' somewhere that I never seen

Feel like I forever dream, just imagine, set a scene

Power and imagination got all my surroundings changin'

Found a place to drown my brain, it something like it's outer space

But nothin' like the pictures from the astronauts

They showed me back at school

When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man, they had me fooled

I don't know what happened to me

But as soon as it hit me I was fuckin' free

It took me, to somewhere off the map

And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back

I'm somebody now, Harry. Everybody likes me. Soon, millions of people will see me and they'll all like me. It's a reason to get up in the morning. It's a reason to smile. It makes tomorrow alright"

Just party every night gettin' so demented

At that time I'm lookin' in the mirror seein' no reflection

Got me wonderin', why don't they get it?

Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it

Got some liquor on the way, the weed is twistin' you should stay

You still listen when they say the kid is spittin', gettin' paid

But my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage

Cause what's written on the page straight sicker than some AIDS

You came to prepare for the future, I live for right now

Just make sure you give it back

Baby you could wear my hat

If you got something to match

She like to play her stupid games with me

She never seem to have enough

She brought some friends for whoever came with me

So, my homies sayin’ that’s what’s up

And I hear her name’s pretty from different continent

Telling me she’s single but to tell the truth I’m not convinced

It’s all good I’m used to boyfriends always talking shit

Thinking that they players but I’m coach call me Popovich

Baby I ain’t doctor rich, but I’ll probably show you a good night

When girls come out with me they make sure that they look right

She used to be so grounded, all of a sudden she took flight

And we ain’t seen her since so tell me what does that look like

I’m the type to bring you right back down to earth

And for what it’s worth I’ll put that Louis on your purse

She like to wear my hat make me laugh so I’m guessing she a keeper

I think she stole it though I keep trying to reach her

Baby you could wear my hat

Just make sure you give it back

Baby you could wear my hat

If you got something to match

I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat

But now she think she got it like that

I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat

Mmm I think she think she got it like that"
400,Wedding,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-wedding-lyrics,Faces,True,"""Okay, you work a God damn lousy job, you know. You come home at night, you're tired. What are you going to do? Go to a movie? Turn on your radio? Hell no. You're going to get a bottle of whiskey and drink it, and go down to a bar and maybe get in a fist fight and meet some bitch. Something's going on. Then you'll go to work the next day, and do your simple little things, right?""

Yeah, yeah, yeah

My bitch can tell that I'm addicted to pussy, she looking past it

The smile that she faking is tragic, hate looking at it

That magic I tried to grasp it, she's had it with the dramatics

Fantasizing love so classic

Attracted to what she got up in her attic

Can we mind fuck?

Do I lie when I look inside her eyes? Hush, don't say a word

I know I make you hurt, sorry is my favorite word

I don't deserve your trust, but can we make it work?

I hate to end the story

Can we wait until the morning to decide on it?

Spend this time pretending it was that first summer

We was pure lovers

She was used to being hurt, I took that curse from her

Sometimes I wonder what it's all for

You wish that I would call more

You're sick of seeing condoms in my sock drawer

Loves turns to war so quickly

I envisioned us married and 50

Couple of kids that we drop off at little league

I'm addicted to you

You only want the best, I need to listen to you

I'm fucking other girls wishing it's you

Fuck the bullshit, we in love

I'm a mess, but can you clean me up?

Girl I'm the worst

Yea, I know that I'm the worst

Yea, but you're something I can't lose

Let me just tell you the truth, that'd be a first

Girl I'm the worst

Yea, I know that I'm the worst

Don't know what I gotta do

Just love you so much that it hurts

And I see you falling victim to the thirst

All the sins you committed

You could probably use a couple minutes in church

But, for what it's worth, I think you're perfect

There's an angel hiding underneath your surface

Yeah, the woman of my dreams, I'm looking at her sleep

The pussy right in-front of me, I shouldn't be so weak

What did I do to deserve a love like this?

You see her shining? That's my sunlight bitch

I'm sick of fighting, that smile is so inviting

I see you every time I'm writing

I'm losing to all my vices, they kicking my ass

I hold on to this feeling, I wish it would last

Don't wanna lose you for some evil I did in the past

You knew I fucked that bitch and you didn't react?

Girl, it's me and you, how simple is that?

Gave me all your love and now I'm giving it back

But I know, that

Girl, you the worst

Yeah, you know that you the worst

But I'm something you can't lose

If you just told me the truth, that'd be a first, but

Girl, you the worst

Yeah, you know that you the worst

Every time you say you sorry

Everything you do just feel like it's rehearsed"

Getting high to deal with my problems

Conversations we having

Too much on my plate

We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, fuck it

We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight

We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight

I been having trouble sleeping

Battling these demons

Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing

Is it money, fame or neither?

I been thinking about the places that I frequent

All the people that I see

I’m just out here livin' decent

What do it mean to be a G?

And all the time we fall behind

Bitches in the concubine

I call her mine, crazy

She ain't' God as I

I make water wine

Pause in time

It's common, they often hate me

Never will I walk in line

I cross the T's and dot the I's

Wondering, well, wonderin' how I got this high

Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn

I'm poppin' them downers

And drinkin' them powders, faded

Get it over the counter

I'm stuck on the browser

Like, how did I make it?

These bitches don't know me

This shit is so lonely until she get naked

Don't even know what today is

But I'll be good by the weekend

I'll be good by the weekend

Everything good by the weekend

Everything will be good by the weekend

Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it

Tuesdays I’m in, gotta get my hands up on ya

Wednesdays I'm lit with you, you know you're staying over

Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you

Cause Fridays are always

The start of the time of my life, alright

When I get faded you hate it

But, baby, it’s gon be alright, ha, alright"
402,What Do You Do,https://genius.com/Mac-miller-what-do-you-do-lyrics,Faces,True,"This tambourine

Shaker

Man, I think I'm Eric Andre

Man, I think I'm Louis C-K

Man, I think so therefore I am

Man, It's 8 A.M

Man, my mind is an emporium of cute naked hoes

My brother one of the only ones I can confide in

It ain't no water in the pool, go ahead and dive in

I toot my horn, I blow my bugle

I recycle, I say ""free beluga whales"" on YouTube

What do you do?

Okay, the pussy like trouble cause I'm in it often

A drug habit like Philip Hoffman will probably put me in a coffin

But down the slope in my toboggan

Three day delirium, gettin' weirder than Austin

Now it's 7 in the morning, this rapper life is so boring

Still at it

The drug absorbent, endorphin addict

The evil follow me, I got a devil magnet

I know a bitch will let you fuck her for Coachella passes

Oh so pompous the ambiance

You remind me of the lobby of the Mondrian

I saw you meditating, get your Gandhi on

If she got that stank puss then I won't be long

Never lose your mind because insanity is brutal

Life's just like college, all you have's your noodle

Mirror mirror on the wall, I'm staring at a dead man

Me and Mikey go back like Bron-Bron's headbands

White American, hotter from the Aryan

New Tibetan Mastiff, he hate it when you stare at him

Jumping in say I fuck with you the long way

I love you more than Kanye love Kanye

Slave to the W, I don't hang with losers

I'm in the suburbs doing drive-by's on Razor scooters

It's my first try, so I got a 3rd eye

It's work time, sell the coke to the students out in Irvine

Coming off the high, listening to Jamiroquai

Why we going through hell when we trying to get to paradise?

It's like we ain't scared of death but we scared of life

It's like we shooting for the stars but we scared of heights

I'm in-doors, pair of gym shorts, with the Sith Lord

We might go bowling later, maybe play Connect 4

Get high, fucking with the Tech Deck

Call in local middle schools and send in some death threats

Hey look, when I tell you this, I mean this seriously, from the bottom of my heart

I need the briefcase in 15 minutes, or everybody's finished

I love my powder white, prefer my bitches black

I'm getting lit with Dash, she don't see us in the back

No longer little Mac, a briefcase with a million, cash

Oh yea

Let me off at the top, let me off at the top

Let me off at the top, let me off at the top

Let me off at the top, let me off at the top

Let me off at the top, let me off at the top

Let me off at the top, we can keep riding for now

Let me off at the top, the road keeps winding around

Let me off at the top, oh I'm high as the clouds

Let me off at the top, hey motherfucker shut your fuckin' mouth

There's somethin' about it

That just freaks me out

I just want another minute with it, fuck a little

Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

Yeah, okay we're colder than the breeze

But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker hol' up

You don't need to hol' up, yeah

And I can show you how I seem

What it is, what it truly might be, nothin' that you know of

You don't need to hol' up

I'm so a-bove and beyond

You take drugs to make it up way up where we on

Space shuttle, Elon

Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up

Then I have her sing just like Céline Dion

Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn

Whole lotta ""yes I am""

All the way in wit' no exit plan

Already left and the jet don't land

Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside

This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh

Can I mind my business?

Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness

Get a little senti- -mental when I'm off the juice 

Well I'ma give you what you came for, yeah

Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are

Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day

Crib long range with the yard

I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me

'Cause I save the day spendin' money

When I had nothin', shit it wasn't so funny

Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry

Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name

But it never worried my brain

Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'

Tell the sun, ""Get up outta my shade""

If they don't get the picture, cut 'em out of that frame, shit

I'm up 30 thou' miles plus change

It's been a while but I'm down 'till I'm out and it is what it is 'til it ain't, yeah

Ooh oooh

Ooh, I just wanna fly

You can love it, you can leave it

They say you're nothin' without it

Don't let them keep you down

What if I don't need it?

There's something about it

That just freaks me out

I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'

Just makin music, I hope you feel it

But now I got a couple things that I gota deal with

Soo what up cousin...

How you been, homie?

What it is, homie?

Without you here, your family feel lonely

But it's all good cousin, we gone carry on

Although it seems so unfair your gone

People nowadays neva focus on the positives

Cause life nows only good when the guap is big

They talkin shit, hatin for no reason

Haters is stupid...baby my flow ,leave'em

So confused cause they all up bout this dumb shit

Lisa said she love it and the other shit is rubish

So ima make my time here worth it, real god for you

Lookin' back like theres nothin I couldn't do

And theres nothin that I wouldn't do to bring you back

Poetry, heart an soul singin rap, i've been thinkin that I

Found my passion rappin bout the future in an old school fashion

What up cousin, how are you feelin'?

I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'

Just makin music, I hope you feel it

But now I got a couple things that I gota deal with

Soo what up cousin...

They say my style ain't different, im just like ery body else

They say my pitches gota change up, but all those people is

Just hatin cause they dont know how to love theyself

Mad when someone bring my name up

An its unfortunate cause im just here comin from the heart

Shit, I'm just tryna find somethin for the market

An I ain't sayin that I'm from the worst hardships, but

My life ain't no walk in the park, its been a shark pit

Dark with no harvest, drivin in a car but can't find a place to park it

I got some people that I really need to talk with

That musta been what got this shit started

Theres been some people that I havn't said goodbye to

But my life gota go on, an it dont mean that we forget

Because we dedicate our lives to, thats why I wrote this fuckin song

What up cousin, how are you feelin'?

I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'

Just makin music, I hope you feel it

But now I got a couple things that I gota deal with

Soo what up cousin...

Shits real out there, ain't nobody playin' round

I got some bangers an some druggies that I hang around

Erry body does their own thing and you can find me

On the corner makin money when its snowing

I sell a lil weed, get my pockets fat

But I talk to cats who be movin lots of crack

It ain't the good life, it ain't the bad, its just makin the best of what we have

I'll put the dollars down an move into the lab

Thats how much I want this music shit to last

An some days I feel its movin to fast

Schools gone pass, not rememberin a class

Start to leave, before you know its time to grow up

Focus on the real try not to get ya hopes up

So far ive had some hard work an a lil luck

Some make it to the money, I ain't gone giveit up

What up cousin, how are you feelin'?

I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'

Just makin music, I hope you feel it

But now I got a couple things that I gota deal with

Fuck being famous, I'm here to fuck up your favorite

Lucifer is human, so are we

All I ever want is what I need

And that don't include your time and company

Follow me, we on the up and up

Remember when I owed a hundred bucks?

Now, I look around like, ""What the fuck?""
