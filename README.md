## Results
Mac Miller was a influential artist from his early days to his last. His ability to use language to tell a story was always evident in word selection, and he seemed to alwys circle back to what he knew best in a way that many people could relate to. His struggle with depression and addiction are evident throughout his discrography, especially in his most "negative" works, according to the sentiment analysis. As he evolved as a musician his themes built upon themselves as is evident with the ebs and flows of the 6 topics in the modeling analysis. Mac Miller's legacy may ultimately be this polarity to be such a positive light to others while still battling deep personal demons internally, a dichotomy that may have contributed to his death in someway.

## Future Work
Next steps on this project would include:
  1. Build song recommender
  2. Write a blog post
  3. Expore other interesting artists with this pipeline
